<h3>Vision of the Spirit</h3>

<p>In childhood I went through a partial loss of eyesight;<br/>but I never knew that.<br/>I used to think,<br/>perhaps vision <em>is</em> something like this -<br/>perhaps everyone sees the world just like me.<br/>One day I took a pair of glasses from a playmate and put them on;<br/>and voilà! Everything was instantly clear.<br/>Then I felt, as if I suddenly came close to everyone else;<br/>the joy of seeing everything clearly and closely,<br/>as if I suddenly gained the whole world twice as much by this -<br/>and yet, I had no idea I was carrying around so much loss for so many days.</p>

<p>Just like this visual closeness, there is a spiritual closeness.<br/>Whoever I approach with that kind of (spiritual) closeness, holds my hand and says: 'you've come!'<br/>We have air, water, the sun, the moon -<br/>they are our great friends;<br/>they are doing so many things for us;<br/>but they are not holding our hands, they are not saying with childlike joy: 'you've come!'<br/>If we were able to go close to them spiritually,<br/>if we were able to listen to their childlike utterances,<br/>and receive their heartfelt touch,<br/>we would have immediately understood how great those small gifts were, compared to all other gifts they were already giving us.<br/>I have been living among all these people all my life;<br/>but these people are not holding my hands, these people are not saying: 'you've come!'<br/>I'm wandering in this world - encased, as it were - within a hard shell.<br/>It's just like a baby bird right before its birth;<br/>it's encased within the egg,<br/>and not yet been born,<br/>although it has come to the earth.</p>

<p>Spiritual birth is nothing but the birth from this egg of semi-dark consciousness.<br/>And it is with this birth that we will become <em>twice-born</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.<br/>And only this birth is the right kind of birth in this world -<br/>the birth of individual consciousness in the Eternal Consciousness.<br/>Only then the baby bird receives complete protection under its mother's wings;<br/>only then a person receives that Everything, everywhere.<br/>How wonderful that success must be!<br/>And how indescribable the joy!<br/>We don't know that success or that joy,<br/>but don't we at least catch its glimpses every other moment in life!</p>

<p>Spirituality doesn't give us much;<br/>but it removes our indifference, our inertness.<br/>Only then we perceive the Eternal Consciousness in our individual consciousness,<br/>and the Eternal Spirit in our individual spirit.<br/>When we perceive that way,<br/>no confusion remains anymore,<br/>as to the fact that everything indeed comes from His Eternal Joy.</p>

<p>From a blade of grass to a complete human being -<br/>wherever in this world my mind is indifferent,<br/>it is to be realized that our own spirituality has been constrained under those circumstances.<br/>When our consciousness, our spirit radiates everywhere,<br/>we feel all the spirits in this world by our spirit alone;<br/>not by our senses, not by our intellect, and not by any scientific argumentation.<br/>That complete feeling is a strange sensation.<br/>Even if I deeply feel this tree in front of me as that Universal Spirit,<br/>my whole individual consciousness becomes filled with joy.<br/>Since I don't usually see the tree that way,<br/>even as my gaze falls on it, I pass by casually, saying:<br/>'Oh it doesn't matter to me';<br/>the spirit of this tree never enters my spirit to raise it to Universal Consciousness,<br/>to make me the rightful inheritor of that Joy.<br/>It is the same with human beings.<br/>We don't look upon fellow human beings with the vision of the Spirit -<br/>we view them through senses, through argumentation, through selfishness, through our family and friends, through our habits and prejudices -<br/>we view them as one of our family, as one of our 'friends in need', as one with whom there is no relationship, or as one of a special kind -<br/>so our introduction ends right there, and the door closes right there,<br/>we cannot enter any further -<br/>and my spirit cannot clearly call that person a spirit too.<br/>If it could, it would have held hands and said: 'you've come!'</p>

<p>The final goal of all spiritual endeavors is clearly mentioned in the Upanishads:</p>

<p align = "center"><em>Te Sarvagam Sarvatah Praapya Dheeraa<br/>Yuktaatmaanah Sarvamevaavishanti.</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The gentle enter everywhere, as they are united in Spirit, and as they have received that Everything everywhere.</p>

<p>This power - the power to enter everywhere - is the last one.<br/>To enter is the same as being united.<br/>When all the coverings of desires, of habits, of prejudices - are removed,<br/>our individual spirit unites everywhere with the Universal Spirit;<br/>it indeed <em>enters</em> everywhere.<br/>Reaching that Universal Spirit is essential,<br/>because otherwise the individual spirit stops merely at the door -<br/>and gets trapped in its own mortal shell -<br/><em>Amritam Yadvibhaati</em>, He who reveals Himself within everyone as pure nectar, remains ever-unreachable by the individual soul;<br/>it observes everything except <em>Aanandarupamamritam</em> - Pure Joy, full of Immortal Bliss.</p>

<p>And this entering of the individual spirit in the Universal Spirit everywhere in this world - indeed - is the final goal of our struggle.<br/>We must realize it is this path alone that we are treading every day.<br/>This cannot happen as long as spiritual blindness and inertness persist within us.<br/>Only the spirit can manifest the Spirit.<br/>Every day we need to understand -<br/>little by little the gate is opening,<br/>and our reach is expanding.<br/>We are mixing more freely with everyone else,<br/>slowly but surely all conflicts are being resolved,<br/>the Universal Spirit is manifesting Itself every day more and more clearly -<br/>in dealings with people, and in day-to-day activities.<br/>Previously there was an insurmountable partition of 'I'-ness that ruthlessly divided me and everyone else -<br/>that partition is slowly dissolving and fading away;<br/>the Light of the Infinite is manifesting Itself more and more clearly through the transparent sections of the partition -<br/>I'm not improperly influencing anyone anymore,<br/>I'm not cutting anyone off anymore,<br/>the mental blocks that used to exist between me and another person are being removed every day.</p>
