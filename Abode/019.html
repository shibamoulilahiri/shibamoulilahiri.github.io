<h3>Dispersed fair</h3>

<p>The human mind<br/>on one hand<br/>is only saying:<br/>'I want, I want, I want';<br/>likewise,<br/>on the other hand -<br/>just behind the first utterance -<br/>it is voicing<br/>another thought -<br/>'I don't want, I don't want, I don't want.'<br/>Right now<br/>it<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> says,<br/>'I cannot go without it';<br/>immediately after<br/>it says<br/>'I don't need it'.</p>

<p>People from the dispersed fair<br/>were saying yesterday night:<br/>'If we can only get<br/>some firewood<br/>and<br/>some dry leaves -<br/>that would save us!'<br/>Then it so seemed<br/>as if<br/>without<br/>those materials,<br/>there would be no future.<br/>In Winter,<br/>under the open sky<br/>on the field,<br/>it was building that little bit of protection<br/>that seemed to serve<br/>the most important necessity<br/>in the World.<br/>Somehow building a stove<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>,<br/>somehow burning dry leaves,<br/>somehow cooking whatever was at hand -<br/>and eating the resulting food -<br/>the efforts to do these<br/>became very urgent<br/>as well.<br/>To these desires<br/>and these efforts -<br/>all other affairs of the World became smaller.</p>

<p>In some way<br/>this firewood<br/>and dry leaves and twigs<br/>were collected.<br/>But, today<br/>even as the night<br/>was not completely finished,<br/>I could hear:<br/>'Hey, where is the cart?<br/>Hey, bring the bullocks!'<br/>We need to go,<br/>now we need to go back to the village.<br/>This need<br/>to go back<br/>is, verily, now<br/>bigger than<br/>anything else.<br/>The immediate needs<br/>of yesterday night<br/>today<br/>remained cast-away<br/>as mere garbage;<br/>the things<br/>people called 'very necessary' yesterday -<br/>today,<br/>the same people<br/>are so busy<br/>getting rid of them<br/>and moving on.</p>

<p>The Universal Human Being, too,<br/>just like this,<br/>Is Arranging to move on<br/>from one eon<br/>into another eon.<br/>When the new morn is rising,<br/>when the night is about to turn into dawn -<br/>then<br/>one person<br/>is pushing another,<br/>calling him/her:<br/>'Hey, let's go!<br/>Hey, where is the cow!<br/>Hey, where is the cart!'<br/>Then<br/>those materials -<br/>materials that were so very necessary<br/>at night,<br/>in this daylight<br/>were thrown away<br/>with - as it were - utter shame<br/>and<br/>as<br/>very unnecessary<br/>garbage.<br/>From dry leaves,<br/>smoke is still rising;<br/>their ashes are piling up.<br/>Broken pots,<br/>pans,<br/>Sal leaves -<br/>the whole field<br/>is littered with them.<br/>The rest houses -<br/>left behind by the resters,<br/>have assumed<br/>a very shabby and shameful look.<br/>Everything remained -<br/>the Eastern Sky has turned red,<br/>now everyone needs to get going.<br/>Again,<br/>again<br/>it is the time<br/>to collect<br/>the necessities<br/>of<br/>yet another eon.<br/>Then they will think,<br/>these needs<br/>of now<br/>are ultimate;<br/>never again,<br/>not on any other day<br/>at dawn<br/>these bullocks shall need to be<br/>joined to<br/>the cart.<br/>Saying so,<br/>again -<br/>it is possible<br/>to<br/>get oneself busy<br/>with<br/>collecting<br/>firewood<br/>and<br/>dry twigs.<br/>But,<br/>then also<br/>this extremely immediate need -<br/>from its far frontal horizon<br/>words are coming<br/>in sorrowful <em>Bhairavii</em><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> tune:<br/>'There is no need, there is no need.'</p>

<p>If this small tune<br/>were not present,<br/>if within this extreme necessity<br/>extreme lack of necessity didn't reside,<br/>then<br/>could we have survived?<br/>If the needs<br/>were truly immediate,<br/>then their tremendous pressure -<br/>who would have been able to withstand?<br/>The days and nights<br/>that are extremely unnecessary -<br/>they have stolen<br/>the weight of this<br/>extreme need,<br/>and that is exactly why<br/>we are able to move about<br/>even within the<br/>extremely strong gravity<br/>that is of necessity.<br/>It is precisely because of this<br/>that<br/>the moment<br/>dawn's light<br/>shows itself to us,<br/>we are able to<br/>cast away<br/>heaps of trash<br/>here and there,<br/>in whatever fashion -<br/>and then we are able to<br/>hop onto the cart<br/>and sit there.<br/>Saying 'Nothing remains' -<br/>we are heaving deep sighs,<br/>and<br/>likewise,<br/>saying 'Nothing moves' -<br/>we are not getting despondent.<br/>Things are verily staying<br/>and<br/>things are verily going,<br/>in the middle of<br/>these two<br/>we have gained a hiatus -<br/>we have gained a shelter;<br/>our rooms have been arranged for us,<br/>and<br/>our light and air, too,<br/>have not been taken away.</p>
