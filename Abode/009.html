<h3>Harmony of Conflicts</h3>

<p>One of the hymns in the <em>Vedas</em> reads,<br/>death is His shadow, immortality too is His shadow -<br/>both He has kept combined within Himself.<br/>He within Whom all conflicts are resolved -<br/>He, verily, is the Ultimate Truth.<br/>He, verily, is the Purest Light;<br/>He, verily, is the Lucidest Darkness.</p>

<p>If the synthesis of all opposites in this World does not happen<br/>within a particular truth,<br/>then that truth cannot be regarded as the Ultimate Truth.<br/>Then, whatever didn't fit within that truth -<br/>for that we need to appeal to another truth,<br/>and these two truths we need to suppose as contradicting each other.<br/>Thus, for Immortality - God,<br/>and for Death - Satan,<br/>both need to be considered.</p>

<p>But, we do not consider any shareholder of <em>Brahman</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> -<br/>we know He is the Only Truth;<br/>all conflicts of partial truths have seen harmony within Him.<br/>We know He is the Only One;<br/>all fragmentations of partial existences exist merged in Him.</p>

<p>But this is theory.<br/>He is Truth -<br/>knowing this,<br/>we only know in principle;<br/>where is the connection<br/>between this and our heart?<br/>Is there no emotion<br/>in this Truth at all?</p>

<p>How will that do?<br/>Just like all truths have merged in Him,<br/>so also all emotions have merged in Him.<br/>That is why,<br/>the <em>Upanishads</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup><br/>have not called Him only Truth;<br/>They have called Him<br/>the Essence of All Emotions -<br/>knowing Him<br/>as that Complete Emotion,<br/>our knowledge is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Then it so stands -<br/>He Who is the Ultimate Truth,<br/>is also the Fulfillment of all Emotions.<br/>That is to say,<br/>He is the Essence of Love.<br/>Otherwise,<br/>it would have been impossible to resolve anything within Him;<br/>differences would have stood as differences,<br/>conflicts would have pummelled us again and again,<br/>and death would have come to us only to steal.<br/>That verily Everything merges within Him,<br/>that mergence<br/>is not a mergence in theory;<br/>within Him,<br/>there is a Principle of Love -<br/>that is why,<br/>Everything <em>must</em> merge -<br/>that is why,<br/>separation and conflicts<br/>can never turn out to be the Eternal Truth.</p>

<p>Whether we know or don't know<br/>any other Last Word -<br/>we have understood<br/>one Last Word<br/>from within ourselves;<br/>That is this -<br/>only within Love<br/>can all conflicts be,<br/>merged together.<br/>In argumentation<br/>they cut each other,<br/>in work<br/>they fight -<br/>no way they want to merge;<br/>in Love,<br/>everything verily resolves.<br/>In the field of argumentation,<br/>in the field of work -<br/>those who are ever ready<br/>like the sons of <em>Diti</em> and <em>Aditi</em><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup><br/>to completely destroy each other,<br/>in Love they are their own siblings.</p>

<p>With respect to argumentation, <em>Dvaita</em> and <em>Advaita</em><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> completely oppose each other;<br/>like 'yes' cuts 'no',<br/>and 'no' cuts 'yes',<br/>similarly they oppose each other.<br/>But in the field of Love,<br/><em>Dvaita</em> and <em>Advaita</em> occupy precisely the same space.<br/>In Love,<br/>at the same time<br/>Two<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> need to be there,<br/>and One<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> also needs to be there.<br/>These two Grand Opposites -<br/>we cannot exclude any of them,<br/>and yet<br/>we cannot let them<br/>oppose each other.<br/>That Which is Opposite -<br/>needs to remain<br/>Un-Opposed;<br/>this one Extraordinary Affair,<br/>this can only happen in Love.<br/>This is why,<br/>the reason why I go to offer myself for others -<br/>I cannot fathom this mystery within myself;<br/>but,<br/>to understand selfishness is not difficult at all.</p>

<p>Since God is the Essence of Love -<br/>He has Created Two<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> out of One<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>,<br/>and One out of Two.<br/>We clearly see that,<br/>Two is True,<br/>and One is True likewise.<br/>This Strange Affair -<br/>cannot be reached<br/>by argumentation;<br/>This, verily, is the Output of Love.</p>

<p>In the <em>Upanishads</em><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>,<br/>we only see<br/>contradicting words about God -<br/>this is why.<br/><em>Ya Ekovarno Bahudhaashaktiyogaat Varnaananekaannihitaartho Dadhaati.</em><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup><br/>He is One<br/>and He has no Color;<br/>and yet,<br/>with various sorts of Power -<br/>That Unborn<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> One<br/>is addressing the deep needs<br/>of many people<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>.<br/>He Who is One -<br/>how does He go about<br/>addressing the needs of Many?<br/>Since He is the Essence of Love -<br/>therefore,<br/>He cannot be by being One Only;<br/>He Verily Remains in addressing the needs of Many.</p>

<p><em>Sa Paryagaat Shukram</em>,<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup><br/>and again,<br/>He Himself is <em>Vyadadhaat Shaashvatiibhyah Samaabhyah</em><sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> -<br/>which is to say,<br/>in Infinite Realms<br/>He Remains -<br/>Still, Pervading;<br/>and again,<br/>in Infinite Time<br/>He Rules,<br/>He Works.<br/>At once,<br/>Stillness is He,<br/>and Movement also is He.</p>

<p>In our nature as well,<br/>the harmony between<br/>this stillness and movement -<br/>we see in only one place;<br/>that is in love.<br/>In the midst of this Restless World -<br/>where our love is,<br/>only at that place<br/>our mind receives rest;<br/>everything else<br/>we merely touch and go,<br/>we catch and throw;<br/>only where there is Love<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> -<br/>it is verily there<br/>that our mind becomes still.<br/>And yet,<br/>it is verily there<br/>that the mind<br/>has more activity.<br/>It is verily there<br/>that our mind<br/>is more active<br/>than anything else.<br/>It is only in Love<br/>that<br/>where we become still,<br/>it is also where we become active.<br/>It is only in Love<br/>that<br/>Stillness and Movement<br/>have received the same name.</p>

<p>In the field of Work,<br/>Renunciation and Gain fall under different categories;<br/>they oppose each other.<br/>In Love,<br/>what is Renunciation<br/>is also, verily, Gain.<br/>The person whom I like,<br/>whatever I give him/her -<br/>that Giving - verily - is Love.<br/>In the accounts ledger of Joy,<br/>Credit and Debit are together;<br/>in there,<br/>What is Giving,<br/>is also verily Receiving.<br/>God, too, in His Creation<br/>has Started<br/>this Sacrifice of Joy,<br/>this Play of Love -<br/>in this Play,<br/>He is Gaining Himself,<br/>by Himself.<br/>To make this Giving and Receiving<br/>Completely Equal,<br/>is called Love.</p>

<p>In Philosophy, there is a big argument.<br/>Whether God is all-pervading or not,<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup><br/>whether He is with Qualifications or without Qualifications,<br/>whether He is personal or impersonal.<br/>In Love,<br/>this yes and no<br/>have merged together.<br/>In Love, one end is with Qualifications, another without.<br/>Its one side says 'I am', another says 'I am Not'.<br/>Without 'I', there is no Love; without renouncing 'I', there is no Love.<br/>That is the reason why,<br/>whether God is with Qualifications or not -<br/>all those arguments<br/>can only do in the field of argumentation;<br/>that argumentation<br/>cannot even touch Him.</p>

<p>Western theology talks about<br/>our infinite improvement;<br/>we continuously go towards Him -<br/>but never do we reach Him.<br/>Our <em>Upanishads</em> have said,<br/>we cannot reach Him,<br/>and yet we can;<br/>we do not Gain Him,<br/>and yet we do.</p>

<p align = "center"><em>Yato Vaacho Nivartante Apraapya Manasaa Saha.<br/>Aanandam Brahmano Vidvaan Na Vibheti Kutashchana.</em><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>Such a strange, contradictory saying -<br/>in two lines of one verse,<br/>has never been heard - so clearly - anywhere else.<br/>Not only does sentence<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> return from Him,<br/>but also mind;<br/>even the mind returns<br/>without ever reaching Him -<br/>this is a completely clear-cut answer.<br/>And yet,<br/>(S)He who has known the Bliss of That <em>Brahman</em> -<br/>(S)He never gets scared of anything anymore.<br/>Thus,<br/>He Who cannot be Known at all -<br/>can be known in such a way<br/>that<br/>no fear remains anymore,<br/>with respect to anything.<br/>What kind of Knowing is That?<br/>The Knowing of Bliss;<br/>The Knowing of Love.<br/>This - verily - is<br/>Knowing by overpowering<br/>all not-knowings.<br/>It is only in Love<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup><br/>where there is no ultimate contradiction<br/>between<br/>Not Knowing and Knowing.<br/>The wife may not know her husband completely,<br/>from all sides -<br/>when it comes to the knowledge of Philosophy and argumentation;<br/>but,<br/>in the knowledge of love, in the knowledge of joy -<br/>she knows him in such a way that<br/>no Philosopher can know like that.<br/>In the midst of Love,<br/>there is this One Strange Mystery that,<br/>where on one side I don't know anything,<br/>there on the other I know completely.<br/>It is verily in Love<br/>where Infinite is turning Himself over<br/>to the Finite;<br/>and Finiteness is embracing Infinite.<br/>By argumentation, it is impossible to derive<br/>any explanation of this.</p>

<p>In Theology,<br/>it is seen that<br/>Freedom and Bondage<br/>have such an opposing relationship that,<br/>no one cares for the other.<br/>To obtain Freedom by completely obliterating Bondage -<br/>this is the advice to us.<br/>The Freedom thing is - as if -<br/>a Final Thing;<br/>even Western Scriptures<br/>have made this idea<br/>deeply rooted in our mind.<br/>But,<br/>a place exists<br/>where Bondage and Freedom<br/>enjoy<br/>exactly equal glory;<br/>we cannot afford to forget this.<br/>That place<br/>is in Love.<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup><br/>In There,<br/>Bondage doesn't bow down to Freedom -<br/>even by the breadth of a hair.<br/>It is verily Love<br/>that is completely Free;<br/>and it is verily Love<br/>that is completely Bound.</p>

<p>God is not just Free.<br/>If it were to be so,<br/>He would have been totally inert.<br/>He has bound Himself.<br/>If He had not done that,<br/>then Creation would not have happened -<br/>and within Creation,<br/>no rules and no significance would have been observed.<br/>The Blissful Form of His,<br/>The Form by Which He Manifests,<br/>this - verily - is the Form of His Bondage.<br/>It is verily in this Bondage that He is close to us, He is Beautiful to us.<br/>This Bondage is the Bondage of Love between Him and Us.<br/>It is verily in this Free Bondage of His Own Making that<br/>He is our Friend, our Father.<br/>If He hadn't turned Himself over in this Bondage,<br/>then we would not have been able to say that,</p>

<p align = "center"><em>Sa Eva Bandhurjanitaa Sa Vidhaataa.</em><sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>He verily is the Friend,<br/>He verily is the Father,<br/>He verily is the Ruler.<br/>Such a vast, wonderful statement -<br/>would never have come out of the mouth of human beings.<br/>Which one is the vast statement?<br/>That God is Pure, Wise and Free -<br/>This One?<br/>Or,<br/>That He is Bound Together with us -<br/>in the roles of Father, Friend, Spouse -<br/>This One?<br/>Both are Equally Vast Statements.<br/>Since we see Bondage as something very obnoxious -<br/>we have developed a wretched misconception<br/>with respect to that.<br/>Such wretched misconceptions we have many more.<br/>For example, we consider small as <em>trivial</em>,<br/>big as <em>grand</em> -<br/>as if by Mathematics Greatness can be conferred upon someone!<br/>Similarly, we bad-mouth Finiteness. -<br/>As if, what that Finiteness thing is,<br/>we know All of That!<br/>Finiteness is a Vast Mystery.<br/>This Finiteness verily reveals the Infinite.<br/>This is so unspeakable!<br/>So strange are Its Forms,<br/>so strange are Its Colors,<br/>so strange is Its Development!<br/>From one Form to another,<br/>from one Color<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> to another,<br/>from one Power to another -<br/>where is an end to these!<br/>Where is the boundary of these!<br/>That Finiteness is expressing Itself<br/>in Unimaginable Diversity,<br/>in Uncountable Multitude,<br/>in Unending Series of Changes -<br/>to be able to disrespect all that -<br/>whose Power is so Mighty!<br/>Effectively, we only disrespect our own language ourselves;<br/>but, to disrespect the Finiteness object -<br/>we don't have that Right.<br/>Compared to Infinite,<br/>Finiteness is no less strange in any of Its parts;<br/>compared to the Unsaid,<br/>the Said is in no way unworthy of Respect.</p>

<p>Even with Freedom and Bondage,<br/>we keep playing with words.<br/>That Bondage too reigns supreme -<br/>sitting on the same Throne as Freedom -<br/>together with the Latter -<br/>we keep forgetting this.<br/>That we <em>only</em> want Freedom -<br/>that is not the case;<br/>we want Bondage too.<br/>The Want in Which<br/>these two wants within us<br/>receive complete harmony -<br/>that is the Want of Love<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>.<br/>Respecting Bondage we shall overcome It -<br/>this is the Work of Love.<br/>The way Love is Free -<br/>so Free there is no second one;<br/>and yet,<br/>the Bondage of Love -<br/>where in the world does such a Vast Bondage exist?</p>

<p>The <em>Vaishnava</em><sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> Religion has shown us<br/>how vastly Glorious that Bondage Thing is.<br/>With strange courage,<br/>with utter shamelessness<br/>It has spoken:<br/>God has mortgaged Himself with Living Beings -<br/>the very Existence of Living Beings<br/>is predicated on that vast Glory.<br/>Our glorious pride is this -<br/>He has not been able to leave us out -<br/>He has admitted to this Bondage -<br/>otherwise,<br/>how do we exist?</p>

<p>Like the mother serves the child,<br/>like the lover serves her/his love interest,<br/>likewise, He is serving us all over the World.<br/>He Himself has become the Servant -<br/>has given Infinite Importance to the Concept of Service.<br/>With that Magnanimous World of His,<br/>He could have thrown parties after parties,<br/>but why is He trying so hard to entice <em>our</em> mind?<br/>In sundry guises, in sundry ways -<br/>why is He creating so uncountably many loving relationships<br/>between the World and us?<br/>Where is the end to this needless effort of<br/>creating these loving relationships?<br/>From sundry sides,<br/>He is only telling,<br/>I am Giving My Bliss to You,<br/>You Give Your Happiness to Me.<br/>He has verily Bound Himself on four sides -<br/>in the wonderful rhythm of Finiteness;<br/>otherwise,<br/>the Ballad of Love cannot reveal Itself.</p>

<p>Wherever our love is not merging well with<br/>this Essence of Love,<br/>there its dissonance is ringing in the Whole World.<br/>There -<br/>how many miseries are rising -<br/>there is no end to that;<br/>tears flowing.<br/>Oh My Love,<br/>You will not Take Love from me by Force,<br/>You will entice me -<br/>then One Day<br/>You will make me cry<br/>in all my heart and psyche -<br/>and then,<br/>You will make me pay the Debt of Your Love.<br/>That is why<br/>it's getting this late -<br/>that is why<br/>the evening is coming,<br/>and yet<br/>my party dress is incomplete.</p>
