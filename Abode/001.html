<h3>Wake up, don't sleep anymore!</h3>

<p>Wake up, don't sleep anymore!<br/>Morning brings God's light to effortlessly end our sleep;<br/>the deep slumber of an entire night is gone in a flash.<br/>But who will end the evening torpor!<br/>Thoughts and deeds of a long day have cast a net of thick fog;<br/>how to pull the mind out of that, into clear, sublime peace?<br/>The whole day has enmeshed us on all sides - just like a spider - weaving one cobweb after another;<br/>it has completely veiled the Eternal, the Infinite;<br/>how to destroy these cobwebs and rouse the Consciousness in that Infinite!<br/>Oh, wake up! Don't sleep anymore!</p>

<p>When the day starts to bind us, on all four sides, one turn after another - with sundry activities, with sundry thoughts, with sundry intentions;<br/>when it starts to build a partition between the world and my soul;<br/>exactly in those moments, if we do not alert our senses from time to time -<br/>'Wake up, don't sleep anymore' - if this awakening spell doesn't keep sounding every moment - from within our innermost depths - in the midst of the sundry affairs of the day;<br/>then turns after turns, knots after knots, overpower us, ultimately making us numb;<br/>then we don't even wish to pull ourselves out of the stupor,<br/>we know the bindings on our four sides as the ultimate truth -<br/>beyond that, the Truth that is forever free, forever open, forever pure - to that we lose all faith;<br/>so much so, that we don't even try to feel doubt at Its existence.<br/>Thus, when an entire day is filled with the hum of sundry affairs,<br/>may the line 'Oh, wake up! Don't sleep anymore!' keep sounding from a chord in the depths of our mind.</p>
