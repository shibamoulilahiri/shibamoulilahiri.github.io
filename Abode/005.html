<h3>Difficulties</h3>

<p>As the spirit thus desires the Spirit,<br/>as no material aspirations can block its progress anymore,<br/>we come to see the difficulties face-to-face.<br/>As our individual consciousness wants to rush forth like a mountain stream,<br/>it immediately feels stumbling stones in the form of hidden desires, and their harsh resistance -<br/>it cannot suppress those desires anymore, even for a moment -<br/>our sick individuality starts screaming, it goes round and round the frothy whirlpools of desires -<br/>in a final wish to destroy them, to remove them.<br/>As our mind starts moving forward, nothing goes unnoticed anymore,<br/>including the smallest pebble that heralds its presence - simply by the resistance it offers.</p>

<p>Before that, we consider good and bad, merits and demerits -<br/>as tickets to social security, family norms, and personal convenience only.<br/>We form our character so that we may fit in the larger society,<br/>so that the rules of politeness are not violated.<br/>If we are successful at that, we rest in peace,<br/>without any further hesitation;<br/>we consider ourselves successful as far as 'character-building' is concerned.</p>

<p>At that moment, one day, when the soul wakes up,<br/>when it starts looking for the Spirit in this world;<br/>it immediately sees that mere politeness will not suffice anymore;<br/>mere preservation of social norms will not do anymore -<br/>the need is much larger,<br/>the resistance much more profound.<br/>We have cleared the road by mowing weeds in a top-down way,<br/>they are not offering any resistance anymore to the path of Life,<br/>they are not even visible to anybody;<br/>and yet, their roots are all buried inside,<br/>they have created a thick mesh by intermingling with each other,<br/>we keep stumbling at every step in that mesh -<br/>in all spiritual endeavors.<br/>Even the minutest and the subtlest of roots keep locking our feet,<br/>creating new partitions.<br/>Then only we see difficulties that were previously unseen,<br/>and realize how resistant they are in our path towards the Final Goal.<br/>Then we start pushing those difficulties away with all our strength -<br/>simply because they are difficulties -<br/>without looking at people, without looking at any social need -<br/>we cannot tolerate those difficulties anymore.<br/>Because they have occupied the path -<br/>path towards our Ultimate Union, our Highest Love -<br/>fully, with all their cronies and followers;<br/>because it is impossible to deceive ourselves and others anymore as to their presence;<br/>because there is no comfort anymore in just being a "good guy" to others;<br/>we start praying to That Pure and Divine with all our heart:</p>

<p>Oh Lord! Cleanse me of all my sins;<br/>all of it, since time immemorial -<br/>not even the slightest trace should remain anymore -<br/>why?<br/>Because You are <em>Shuddham Apaapaviddham</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> -<br/>the spirit craves only for You;<br/>only that wish is the one True Wish it has;<br/>only that wish is its Final Wish.<br/>Oh Lord my All-in-All!<br/>Oh Lord Omnipresent!<br/>That I shall receive You from all sides,<br/>that I shall unite with You everywhere,<br/>that I shall gain entrance into Everyone's mind,<br/>even that amazing fortune - its idea -<br/>does not soothe my mind anymore.<br/>But I beseech You to grant me one favor that,<br/>although I have not been able to manifest Your Divinity to the fullest extent,<br/>let a single ray of Your light come through an opening in my closed door,<br/>so that I can perceive in that light the closed darkness in the room as darkness.<br/>I fell asleep at night after closing all doors and windows;<br/>I slept like a log.<br/>When the morning sun entered my room through the little openings in the closed door,<br/>my sleeping mind suddenly received a jolt -<br/>inert and slothful as it were -<br/>at the fact that a serene morning has arrived outside.<br/>Then the heat of the used bed suddenly felt intolerable;<br/>then the stale air in the room -<br/>stale from my own breath -<br/>started choking me.<br/>I could not stay in the room anymore.<br/>Then the Gentleness, the Purity, the Sacredness of the fetterless Universe -<br/>Its all Beauty, all Fragrance, all Notes of Music -<br/>called me out in the open.<br/>May You send Your Apostle of Light, Your Messenger of Salvation like that -<br/>through one or two apertures of my hard shell if any -<br/>just to ensure that the heat of my own bondage<br/>and the staleness and the darkness<br/>are not making me rest in peace anymore -<br/>the comfortable bed is starting to burn my skin;<br/>so that I have no recourse except crying out:</p>
