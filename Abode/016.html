<h3>Festival of the 7th Paush at Santiniketan</h3>

<p>We cannot <em>design</em> a festival;<br/>if opportunity comes,<br/>then<br/>we can <em>discover</em> a festival.</p>

<p>Wherever Truth Manifests<br/>in a beautiful way,<br/>there, verily, is a festival.<br/>That Manifestation -<br/>when Is It ever stopped!<br/>The bird becomes busy<br/>since pre-dawn -<br/>every single day -<br/>to make it to its morning music festival,<br/>in response to the everyday invitation it had had received earlier.<br/>And,<br/>to decorate the Morning Assembly of Joy<br/>a Person in Darkness<br/>makes so many secret arrangements<br/>all night -<br/>is there any limit to that!<br/>Before getting into bed,<br/>if we but see for once -<br/>then<br/>do we not see<br/>the Huge Banner<br/>of the Everyday Festival of the World -<br/>spreading the Whole Sky -<br/>someone has hung It all across?</p>

<p>Among these,<br/>when is <em>our</em> festival?<br/>The day we can make time -<br/>on that day.<br/>The day we suddenly realize<br/>that<br/>we have an Invitation<br/>and<br/>That Invitation is Dying every day.<br/>That day we take a shower,<br/>we dress up,<br/>and we quickly get out of the house.</p>

<p>On that day,<br/>in the morning of the festival day -<br/>we look up towards the Sky, and say:<br/>'Wow, today the light is so sweet, so pure!'<br/>Hey Stupid,<br/>when was this light not sweet,<br/>when was it not pure?<br/>You have emblazoned<br/>a special sign<br/>on a special day -<br/>is that the only reason<br/>why<br/>the lamp of the Sky has burned brightly!</p>

<p>Nothing else -<br/>today we have come to make the Invitation,<br/>other days we haven't -<br/>that's the only difference.<br/>The arrangements<br/>were just like this -<br/>every day;<br/>they <em>are</em> just like this -<br/>every day.<br/>That This World Is the Form of Bliss<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> -<br/>today I shall see This,<br/>that is why I have come,<br/>leaving all chores behind.<br/>Not just that -<br/>I, too, have given a release<br/>to my Blissful Essence as well;<br/>today I've said,<br/>let the wrangling between credit and debit be ceased for a day -<br/>let the distinction between 'I' and 'others' be obliterated for a day,<br/>let all miserliness die today,<br/>let all the opulence that is there be out today.<br/>The Joy that Reigns everywhere<br/>in water,<br/>in land,<br/>in sky -<br/>That Joy<br/>today I shall see<br/>in the midst of my House of Joy.<br/>The Festival that is the Festival of All -<br/>That Festival<br/>today I shall<br/>make my own festival.</p>

<p>Not just in a single house of this Universe.<br/>Its sundry houses<br/>have made arrangements<br/>for<br/>sundry kinds of festivals.<br/>With people -<br/>without people -<br/>in sundry places<br/>the Festival has several different Moods -<br/>several different Icons of Joy.<br/>In the midst of this meadow -<br/>spread out under the blue Sky -<br/>the everyday festival of this<br/>lovingly shaded, secluded hermitage -<br/>we the residents of that hermitage -<br/>have we ever participated<br/>in That Festival<br/>with the Sun and the Stars -<br/>with the Rows of Trees and Plants?<br/>Have we ever seen This Hermitage<br/>in All Its Truth and Beauty?<br/>We haven't.<br/>Even while residing in the midst of This Hermitage,<br/>every day morning<br/>we have woken up in the midst of the World;<br/>and every day night<br/>we have lain down<br/>in the lap of the World only.</p>

<p>364 days after -<br/>today,<br/>we the residents of the hermitage,<br/>have come to see This Hermitage.<br/>When the Sun was shining<br/>in the Eastern Sky -<br/>we haven't seen It then;<br/>when filling the Sky<br/>the Garland of Stars' Lamps<br/>were all alight -<br/>then too<br/>we haven't seen It;<br/>today, these few oil-lamps of ours -<br/>these few gas-lamps of ours -<br/>lighting these<br/>we shall see It!<br/>OK, let that be -<br/>there is no harm in that.<br/>If we want to participate in the Grand Festival of the Great God,<br/>then<br/>however much savings of light we have -<br/>we too need to bring that out as well.<br/>We shall see Him,<br/>only with His Light -<br/>if it were the case,<br/>then<br/>things would have settled<br/>easily.<br/>But,<br/>this much<br/>He Has Made us promise<br/>that<br/>our lamps, too, shall need to be lighted;<br/>otherwise, the Visit shall not happen<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>,<br/>the Union shall not take place -<br/>the ego He Has Given us,<br/>that is just for this.<br/>Lighting the fire of ego,<br/>we shall make the Torch of the Grand Festival.<br/>That is why -<br/>to see the ever-awake Joy,<br/>I need to awaken<br/>even this tiny amount<br/>of<br/>my own joy;<br/>to know that ever-revealed Knowledge too,<br/>I need to kindle<br/>the tiny wick<br/>of my<br/>small amount of knowledge;<br/>and<br/>He Whose Love Is Overflowing<br/>by Itself,<br/>Flowing in sundry directions -<br/>That Inexhaustible Love of His -<br/>we cannot feel even That Love<br/>unless<br/>we are able to express<br/>this tiny amount of love of ours<br/>like a small jasmine flower.</p>

<p>This is precisely why<br/>the Great Worldwide Festival<br/>of the Lord of the Universe -<br/>we cannot completely participate in That Festival<br/>if we ourselves<br/>do not arrange for a festival<br/>with our own tiny preparation.<br/>That is why<br/>today -<br/>our ego has shamelessly lighted<br/>these few impecunious lamps of its own<br/>in front of the eyes of<br/>Constellations of Stars - Filling the Sky.<br/>Our pride is this:<br/>we shall see Him with our own lamps.<br/>With this pride of ours,<br/>the Great Lord is Happy,<br/>He is Smiling.<br/>These few lamps of ours -<br/>Seeing them all alight -<br/>That Lord of ten million suns<br/>Has Been Joyful.<br/>This, verily, is an auspicious opportunity<br/>to see His Propitious Face.<br/>In This Opportunity,<br/>we shall have to<br/>awaken<br/>all our consciousness.<br/>May this consciousness<br/>rise<br/>in our whole body -<br/>and<br/>thrill every hair,<br/>may this consciousness<br/>vibrate<br/>in every wave of daylight,<br/>may this consciousness<br/>spread out<br/>in the darkness of night;<br/>today,<br/>may it not be scattered with domestic thoughts<br/>in one corner of our house,<br/>may it not remain false<br/>with respect to All -<br/>today,<br/>may it not get depressed, and thus deprived -<br/>anywhere.<br/>All arrangements of the Infinite Assembly,<br/>all visions, all contacts, all unions -<br/>they are waiting<br/>only for<br/>the awakening of this consciousness;<br/>this is precisely why<br/>the lamps are all alight -<br/>the flutes are playing -<br/>the messengers have come<br/>from four sides<br/>and<br/>have stood at our doors;<br/>everything is ready;<br/>oh consciousness, where are you!<br/>Oh, wake up, don't sleep anymore.</p>
