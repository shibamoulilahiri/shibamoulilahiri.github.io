<h3>Love<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></h3>

<p>But, why we shall renounce -<br/>the final answer of this question still didn't arrive in the mind.<br/>The Scriptures say -<br/>it is impossible to be Free without Renunciation;<br/>anything we shall not renounce,<br/>will verily keep us attached;<br/>by Renunciation we will be Free.</p>

<p>That we shall obtain Freedom -<br/>we do not have the power to say so.<br/>Because we are not <em>looking for</em> Freedom;<br/>indeed, we have a terrible tendency towards dependence within us;<br/>indeed, we have become dependent on this World <em>by choice</em> - quite happily;<br/>we are dependent on the silverware utensils,<br/>we are also dependent on the servant;<br/>we are dependent on what people say,<br/>on what they do (their customs),<br/>on myriad tendencies and inclinations;<br/>indeed,<br/>it is in vain to say this to such a big-time born-dependent slave of slaves that,<br/>'you stand to benefit from Freedom'.<br/>It is in vain to entice with Freedom someone who is attached naturally, and by choice.</p>

<p>Effectively, to her/him Freedom is emptiness, extinction, desert.<br/>The Freedom where none of her/his house, property, utensils and cutlery exists;<br/>where everything (s)he considered her/his sole refuge -<br/>all of that has gone extinct;<br/>that Freedom - to her/him - is sheer Terror, utter Loss.</p>

<p>That we shall renounce -<br/>if that renunciation is in emptiness<br/>then that renunciation will turn out to be utter Loss.<br/>Even a single penny -<br/>to renounce it into that field of emptiness -<br/>is totally unbearable for us.</p>

<p>But renunciation is not in emptiness.<br/><em>Yad Yad Karma Prakurviita Tadbrahmani Samarpayet.</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup><br/>Whatever you do,<br/>surrender all of that unto <em>Brahman</em><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.<br/>Your family,<br/>your dear ones,<br/>all that you have -<br/>surrender them unto Him;<br/>this renunciation - verily - is renunciation into Fullness.</p>

<p>Whatever I renounce into Fullness,<br/>I only receive it as Truth, Fully -<br/>I've said this before.<br/>But the matter does not end right here.<br/>No discourse can end at the discussion of mere benefits;<br/><em>what shall happen</em> with those benefits -<br/>this question remains.<br/>What shall happen if we become Free,<br/>what shall happen if we receive Fullness?</p>

<p>When I give money to a child, (s)he may ask: what shall happen with this money?<br/>If I respond: you will go to market;<br/>even then the question is: what shall happen by going to market?<br/>You will buy marionettes.<br/>What shall happen by buying marionettes?<br/>You will play.<br/>What shall happen by playing?<br/>Then, one answer ends <em>all</em> questions -<br/>you will be joyful.<br/>What shall happen by being joyful -<br/>this question no one ever asks from their heart.<br/>The joy that comes from the Final Fulfillment of wishes -<br/>it is in that joy that all questions and all demands finally dissolve themselves.</p>

<p>The Final Fulfillment of all wishes is in Love<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.<br/>In Love -<br/>why, what shall happen -<br/>these questions cannot exist.<br/>Love is Her Own Explanation, Her Own Goal.</p>

<p>If you say,<br/>by renunciation you will receive freedom from the renounced object -<br/>that does not appeal to our mind.<br/>If you say,<br/>by renunciation you will receive the renounced object more fully -<br/>then also our mind does not completely respond to that.<br/>However, if you say,<br/>by renunciation can be obtained Love -<br/>then the mind cannot speak a single word anymore;<br/>if it hears this correctly and attentively,<br/>then it will have to speak up -<br/>'oh that shall save me'.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful relationship between Renunciation and Love;<br/>the relationship is such that,<br/>who is before and who is after -<br/>even to decide that is very difficult.<br/>Sans Love, Renunciation is impossible;<br/>and sans Renunciation, Love cannot be.<br/>Whatever is snatched from us out of sheer necessity<br/>or out of fear of oppression -<br/>that verily is not renunciation;<br/>when we give something away in Love,<br/>we give it completely, we keep none of it anymore;<br/>we consider Giving successful in that give-away.<br/>But this Love,<br/>even this Love finally turns Herself over to us -<br/>in the practice of Renunciation.<br/>The person who only draws things to herself/himself<br/>all the time -<br/>who is busy puffing up her/his own vanity -<br/>that selfish, that vain person<br/>never sees the rise of Love in her/his mind;<br/>the Sun of Love remains altogether covered by fog.</p>

<p>We will need to renounce the attachment of selfishness,<br/>we will need to unknot the Gordian knot of vanity -<br/>whatever we have spent our lives on to accumulate only,<br/>we will need to sit every day to renounce that;<br/>so that the renunciation gradually becomes easy -<br/>so that the attraction of that object to us loosens every day.<br/>Is it the case that<br/>if we keep on doing like this,<br/>we shall receive what is called Freedom?<br/>Yes, you shall receive Freedom.<br/>What shall we gain by receiving Freedom?<br/>We shall gain what is the Final Goal of Freedom - that Love<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Who is Love?<br/>She, verily, is Love Who -<br/>there is no need - and yet,<br/>is renouncing everything,<br/>for us.<br/>She, verily, is the Essence of Love.<br/>She is projecting Her power -<br/>every moment - for us,<br/>in the midst of this Universe;<br/>the Whole Creation<br/>is an Offering<br/>by Her.<br/><em>Aanandaaddhyeva Khalvimaani Bhuutaani Jaayante.</em><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup><br/>It is verily from Bliss that all these are being Created;<br/>nothing is happening out of necessity;<br/>that Self-Born,<br/>that Self-Emanating Love,<br/>verily,<br/>is the Root of All Creation.</p>

<p>Once we are fully connected<br/>to this Essence of Love -<br/>all our wishes will be completely fulfilled.<br/>Full connection will necessitate that<br/>we become like the One with whom connection will be established.<br/>With Love -<br/>it is by Love that connection will happen.</p>

<p>But,<br/>Love is Free -<br/>Love is Independent.<br/>There is no other difference<br/>between slavery and Love -<br/>than the fact that slavery is attached,<br/>and Love is Free.<br/>Love is Herself conclusively established<br/>by Her Own Rules alone -<br/>She does not supply any explanation<br/>about anything to anyone<br/>above Herself.</p>

<p>Therefore,<br/>to merge with the Essence of Love<br/>we will need to be completely Free.<br/>No one<br/>other than (S)He Who is Free<br/>can maintain a give-and-take relationship<br/>with Another Who is also Free.<br/>We have had this conversation with Him;<br/>He has told us -<br/>you come to Me after receiving Freedom;<br/>the person who is a slave -<br/>for him/her My front room is open;<br/>but (s)he will not be able to enter My inner sanctuary.</p>

<p>From time to time, out of eagerness of mind -<br/>we rush towards the door of that inner sanctuary of His;<br/>but the doorkeeper sends us back again and again.<br/>He says,<br/>where is your Letter of Invitation!<br/>Hunting for that Letter,<br/>I notice that<br/>whatever letters of invitation I have -<br/>they are invitation for fame and invitation for money,<br/>not Invitation for Nectar.<br/>I needed to come back again and again -<br/>again and again!</p>

<p>There is no way to elude the ticket-examiner.<br/>We have bought the ticket for whichever station -<br/>we will need to get down at that station only.<br/>We have bought ticket for sundry destinations on this World-track -<br/>with long-term practice, and accumulation of much suffering;<br/>that ticket shall not do for another track.<br/>From now on,<br/>every day we shall need to collect money for yet another track.<br/>From now on,<br/>whatever we will need to collect, and whatever we will need to renounce -<br/>they are only for That Love.</p>

<p>How shall we collect?<br/>Within this everyday prayer of ours,<br/>we are accumulating little by little.<br/>In this morning,<br/>to see my own consciousness -<br/>intimately surrounded by the Essence of That Consciousness,<br/>even for a moment<br/>I am having to renounce all my coverings;<br/>I am having to surrender myself to Him like a newborn babe -<br/>without any covering;<br/>it is by these<br/>that day by day<br/>little by little<br/>I shall accumulate.<br/>Bliss with happiness,<br/>Love with love -<br/>these minglings<br/>are verily becoming more-or-less easy<br/>in a gradual way.</p>

<p>How shall we renounce?<br/>Within this World,<br/>please start at least one Welfare Sacrifice.<br/>For That Welfare Sacrifice,<br/>if you keep open even a very small door of your storeroom,<br/>then you shall see -<br/>today, as the door is creaking loudly at a small tug,<br/>the door that has not been opened in years -<br/>the door in whose rusty locks no keys are turning fully,<br/>gradually,<br/>opening that door will turn out to be like a very small thing;<br/>in an Auspicious Occasion,<br/>Renunciation having started shall gradually spread out more and more.<br/>We give Everything to the World -<br/>day and night;<br/>please give something to God -<br/>every day,<br/>at least once<br/>give alms of a handful;<br/>that Desireless Destitute with His Alms-Bowl in hand,<br/>smilingly<br/>every day,<br/>is coming to our doors -<br/>and returning every day.<br/>If we practise<br/>Giving Him alms of a handful<br/>then that Giving<br/>shall verily become more than all that we have.<br/>Gradually,<br/>that shall not fit in our palms anymore;<br/>gradually,<br/>we shall not be able to keep anything in our hands anymore.<br/>But,<br/>however much we shall Give Him,<br/>that much we shall have to Give Secretly -<br/>for that it will not do to ask for even a tiny amount of fame from anyone.<br/>The reason is,<br/>giving after showing off to people -<br/>is like<br/>giving in one way,<br/>and then stealing in another.<br/>That Great Beggar -<br/>however much we shall Give Him - even if a tiny amount,<br/>we need to Give It Completely.<br/>It shall not do<br/>to keep Its accounts;<br/>it shall not do<br/>to ask for a receipt.<br/>In the day,<br/>may at least one of our givings<br/>be a Complete Giving like this;<br/>may That Giving<br/>be a Complete Renunciation unto That Essence of Completeness,<br/>and in this World, in this small Affair -<br/>may every day<br/>an interval open up to allow a Secret Rendezvous<br/>between me, alone,<br/>and Only Him.</p>
