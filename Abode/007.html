<h3>Renunciation</h3>

<p>That we keep praying thus every morning -<br/>if there is any Truth in that,<br/>it is that every day we are preparing ourselves - little by little - for renunciation.<br/>Preparation is extremely necessary because,<br/>there is a Law of Renunciation in this world -<br/>its injunctions are inescapable.<br/>That Law never makes us rest anywhere;<br/>it keeps saying: renounce, and move on.<br/>I'm not seeing anything anywhere, where I can reach and say -<br/>this is it, I'm done, everything is finished, everything is fulfilled; and I'll never move from here.</p>

<p>If it is the case that the Law of this World is not just holding on to something, but<br/>letting go and moving on,<br/>then if we do not harmonize our desires with that Law,<br/>there will only be discord between the two.<br/>If we only keep saying 'we'll stay', 'we'll keep', and the world says 'you better let go', 'keep moving',<br/>then it engenders terrible misery.<br/>Our desires then need to back down -<br/>something which we don't want to renounce gets taken away from us.<br/>Therefore, we need to keep our desires in tune with this Law of the World.</p>

<p>Once we are able to merge our desires with the Law of the World, effectively we become free.<br/>That - indeed - is the Law of Freedom.<br/>If I do not join the World voluntarily,<br/>then the World will force me - will make me its follower;<br/>then I will have no joy, I will not have honor;<br/>then the World will wring my ear, and I will be forced to accept it -<br/>just like a slave.</p>

<p>Therefore, may the World never be able to say this to us - 'I'll take away from you';<br/>may I, instead, be able to say - 'I shall renounce'.<br/>But, if we do not prepare our desires - every day - towards this renunciation, then -<br/>when death shall come, when losses will arrive,<br/>with their bigger and bigger demands,<br/>and stand in front of us,<br/>then we'd wish to cheat them in any way possible,<br/>and yet no cheating will do there at all -<br/>that, indeed, will turn out to be a very miserable day for us.</p>

<p>That we receive penury and indigence by this renunciation -<br/>may we never think like this.<br/>Our renunciation is only to Receive more Fully.</p>

<p>We shall not receive something which we shall not have left.<br/>When an infant is protected in the womb, (s)he does not receive her/his mother;<br/>only when (s)he is born, (s)he is free -<br/>by renouncing the bondage of the umbilical cord -<br/>does (s)he receive her/his mother more fully.</p>

<p>We will need to be Free just like that - while staying within the protective womb of this World;<br/>then only we will Truly receive the World,<br/>because,<br/>we will receive the World - Freely.<br/>We cannot even see the World right now,<br/>just like the unborn fetus bound within the womb;<br/>only (s)he who has been Free knows and receives the World.</p>

<p>This is why I'm saying,<br/>the person who is enmeshed in this World -<br/>it is not that that person is really Worldly;<br/>the person who has come out of the World, is really Worldly;<br/>because,<br/>then (s)he is not of the World;<br/>the World is hers/his.<br/>Only that person can Truly proclaim:<br/>'My World'.</p>

<p>A horse pulls a carriage, being attached to it with reins -<br/>but can the horse say, 'the carriage is mine'?<br/>Effectively, is there much difference between the carriage wheel and the horse?<br/>Only the jehu who drives the carriage - being free from it -<br/>has control over the carriage.</p>

<p>If I want to be the lord, I'll need to be free.<br/>This is why the Gita<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> proclaimed only that Yoga<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> as Karma Yoga<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, where we work without attachment.<br/>Only when I work without attachment,<br/>my complete control over that work ensues;<br/>otherwise,<br/>being lumped together with work,<br/>we become a part of the work itself,<br/>we do not become workers.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we want to gain the World,<br/>we will need to get out of it;<br/>and if we want to practise work,<br/>we will need to work avoiding attachment.</p>

<p>What that means is that -<br/>in this World - Giving and Receiving - these two opposite Laws are there;<br/>we will need to harmonize the two;<br/>if only one of them dominates, it will wreak havoc.<br/>If Receiving reigns supreme, we get attached;<br/>and if Giving reigns supreme, we get deprived.<br/>If the work is without freedom, we become slaves;<br/>and if freedom is without work, we go extinct.</p>

<p>Effectively, renunciation is not emptiness;<br/>it is the fulfillment of rights.<br/>An under-age minor cannot donate or sell, until (s)he has full rights on her/his property;<br/>until then (s)he only has a small right to enjoy,<br/>not the big right to renounce.<br/>The state where we can only accumulate, but are unable to give freely -<br/>in that state we have no freedom regarding that accumulated wealth.</p>

<p>This is why Jesus Christ had proclaimed: <em>it is very difficult for someone who is rich to receive Freedom.</em><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup><br/>The reason is,<br/>as much wealth as (s)he is unable to renounce,<br/>that much wealth keeps binding her/him.<br/>Whoever has made that binding bigger and bigger,<br/>has fallen in dangers graver and graver.</p>

<p>That all these bindings are coming loose every day,<br/>that every day renunciation is becoming easy for us,<br/>may we obtain this fruit from our prayer.<br/>The deep attraction of sundry attachments<br/>has altogether made our nature stodgy like stone.<br/>May the Fountain of Nectar keep pouring at the time of prayer -<br/>may it keep entering through the very pores of our atoms and molecules -<br/>may it keep disaggregating and dissolving the stone day by day;<br/>and then gradually,<br/>by eroding and removing the stone,<br/>may it create a big void in the midst of our lives -<br/>only to fill that void.</p>

<p>See,<br/>take a look Inside for once -<br/>'the constrictions of our heart are getting straightened every day<br/>by being hit with His Name,<br/>everything is getting propitious,<br/>everything is getting calm;<br/>the work is getting easy;<br/>relationships with Everyone are getting truthful and undiplomatic;<br/>and the Glory of God is being fulfilled in this human life of mine.'</p>
