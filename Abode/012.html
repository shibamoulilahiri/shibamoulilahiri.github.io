<h3>Fear of Perversion</h3>

<p>In the Worship of Love<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>,<br/>there is a fear of perversion.<br/>Love has a side<br/>that is mainly<br/>the side of emotions -<br/>if we get caught in the lure of that,<br/>then we reach up to only that much -<br/>then only the enjoyment of emotions<br/>we consider<br/>the Ultimate Attainment<br/>of our Worship.<br/>Then this addiction traps us.<br/>Keeping only this addiction awake day and night,<br/>we try to remain oblivious<br/>to the Harshness of Work,<br/>to the Purity of Knowledge -<br/>we forget Work,<br/>we transgress Knowledge.</p>

<p>Thus,<br/>effectively we try to pluck the flower after axing the tree;<br/>no matter how much we become enchanted at the beauty of the flower,<br/>if compared to that,<br/>condemning the tree, calling it rough, calling it inaccessible,<br/>we uproot it<br/>and try to pluck the flower,<br/>then<br/>for that moment<br/>we obtain the flower,<br/>but<br/>we ruin<br/>the principal support<br/>on which<br/>that flower<br/>could bloom<br/>ever anew<br/>for all eternity.<br/>Thus,<br/>aiming excessively at the flower alone -<br/>we only commit injustice and atrocity to it.</p>

<p>From poetry,<br/>we absorb the emotion of thoughts,<br/>and get satisfied.<br/>But the fulfillment of that emotion -<br/>what does that depend on?<br/>That has three supports.<br/>One is the body of the poem - rhyme and language;<br/>other than them,<br/>the thoughts -<br/>which after which,<br/>arranging them in a way that makes their appearance beautiful -<br/>that skill in layout.<br/>The task of designing this framework<br/>cannot be completed<br/>in a slipshod manner -<br/>we need to go about maintaining strict rules;<br/>even the slightest disturbance to that<br/>hurts the meter,<br/>stresses the ear,<br/>and<br/>obstructs the expression of thoughts.<br/>Therefore,<br/>this rhyme, language, and arrangement of thoughts -<br/>while designing them,<br/>the poet<br/>needs to accept the bondage of rules;<br/>in here,<br/>(s)he cannot do whatever (s)he likes.<br/>After that,<br/>there is another big support -<br/>that is the support of knowledge.<br/>All greatest poems have<br/>within them<br/>something<br/>that satisfies our knowledge,<br/>and that awakens our thinking faculty as well;<br/>if the poet<br/>composes her/his poem<br/>on a topic<br/>that is extremely bizarre -<br/>that does not supply any food for our knowledge,<br/>or<br/>that stresses our thinking faculty owing to a perversion of truth,<br/>then in that poem<br/>expression of emotion<br/>gets obstructed;<br/>that poem<br/>cannot give us joy<br/>permanently and deeply.<br/>And the third and final support<br/>is the support of thoughts;<br/>coming in touch with these thoughts<br/>our heart becomes joyful.<br/>Therefore,<br/>in greatest poems<br/>first the satisfaction<br/>of our ears<br/>and our sense of art,<br/>after that<br/>the satisfaction<br/>of our intellect<br/>and after that<br/>the satisfaction of our heart;<br/>if these three satisfactions happen,<br/>then only<br/>along with<br/>the satisfaction of our whole nature,<br/>the emotion of the poem -<br/>that emotion captures our heart<br/>permanently and very deeply.<br/>Otherwise,<br/>either the emotion gets diluted and/or effervesces;<br/>or it gets perverted.</p>

<p>Sugar, honey and jaggery -<br/>when they get perverted,<br/>they ferment,<br/>they turn into alcohol,<br/>they crack their own vessels.<br/>The perversion of psychic emotions, too,<br/>brings intoxication within us;<br/>then the psyche does not accept rules anymore,<br/>it overflows<br/>with impatience<br/>and unrest.<br/>This frenzy of emotions -<br/>when it thrashes our mind,<br/>then that thrashing<br/>we consider<br/>our Attainment.<br/>But,<br/>intoxication can never be called Attainment,<br/>unchastity can never be called Love,<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup><br/>the overwhelming unrest<br/>of fever<br/>and delirium<br/>can never be called an expression of health and strength.<br/>Within intoxication,<br/>there is an acrid intensity,<br/>that intensity<br/>is effectively<br/>not an advantage -<br/>in that,<br/>stealing verily from all other sides of our nature,<br/>only one side<br/>gets inflated unnaturally.<br/>In that,<br/>not only is it the case that<br/>the parts<br/>that get stolen from -<br/>only they suffer loss and atrophy;<br/>but the parts that get inflated and as a result intoxicated -<br/>they, too, do not do well.<br/>Because,<br/>different parts of our nature -<br/>when they remain spontaneously operative,<br/>then only<br/>in connection with every part,<br/>every other part becomes significant;<br/>from one,<br/>if another steals -<br/>then the one that gets stolen from,<br/>it suffers a loss,<br/>and the lifter, too, gets wasted.</p>

<p>That is why<br/>I was mentioning,<br/>if love steals from Truth and Knowledge,<br/>and keeps wandering intoxicated -<br/>its discipline and endurance get wasted,<br/>its faculty of perception becomes lawless,<br/>then<br/>it undoes its own footing in its own hands,<br/>and degenerates itself.</p>

<p>The love we shall worship,<br/>is the worship of a chaste wife.<br/>In that love,<br/>all three attributes of chastity will be there;<br/>in that,<br/>there will be modesty,<br/>there will be intellect,<br/>and<br/>there will be beauty.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup><br/>In that,<br/>there will be reserve,<br/>there will be reflection,<br/>and<br/>there will be grace.<br/>This love,<br/>in this World -<br/>in coming and going,<br/>in speech and utterances,<br/>in work and duties,<br/>in debit and credit,<br/>in small and large,<br/>in happiness and misery,<br/>extensively and therefore with discipline,<br/>innocently and sweetly<br/>will keep revealing itself.<br/>There is an innate modesty in love;<br/>when that covering of modesty is intact,<br/>only then<br/>the love can spread itself widely;<br/>otherwise,<br/>it burns out in only one direction,<br/>perhaps destroying the work,<br/>perverting knowledge,<br/>hurting the World,<br/>and<br/>expending itself completely<br/>in one breath.<br/>It is by modesty alone<br/>that<br/>a chaste wife<br/>contains her own love<br/>and<br/>spreads it out in sundry directions -<br/>this way,<br/>that love<br/>burns no one,<br/>illumines every one.<br/>Our Earth<br/>has such a covering;<br/>that is the covering of air.<br/>It is with this covering<br/>that the Earth<br/>spreads out sunlight<br/>everywhere -<br/>in a measured<br/>and<br/>extensive way.<br/>If this covering were not there,<br/>where the sun would have shone,<br/>that place would have been burnt out completely;<br/>in the very least,<br/>that place would have been ruthlessly sunny;<br/>and exactly by its side,<br/>where there was shadow,<br/>there ice-cold death<br/>and<br/>densest darkness<br/>would have reigned.<br/>The love of an unchaste wife,<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup><br/>where there is no modesty,<br/>no restraint,<br/>that love<br/>cannot spread itself out everywhere<br/>in a measured way;<br/>that love<br/>in one place spreads violent burning,<br/>and exactly by its side -<br/>spreads out an indifference<br/>that is without any vigor,<br/>and bereft of light.</p>

<p>For us, too,<br/>in this love of a chaste wife<br/>in the country house of our psyche,<br/>there shall be intellect,<br/>there shall be purity of Knowledge.<br/>This love<br/>is not an ignorant love,<br/>tangled in the snare of habits and prejudices.<br/>Like animals,<br/>this is not a blind love<br/>that is entirely instinctual.<br/>Its vision is awake,<br/>its psyche is open.<br/>This love<br/>does not want to fool itself<br/>with some imaginary object;<br/>the one this love wants,<br/>for that person<br/>it demands unrestrained access,<br/>with respect to that person<br/>it cannot tolerate<br/>the possibility of keeping its own Knowledge affronted.<br/>In its mind,<br/>there is this only one fear that,<br/>in the excessive desire to obtain,<br/>it keeps itself quiet<br/>after receiving<br/>any one wrong thing.<br/>Just like a bird<br/>that is eager to sit on her eggs,<br/>and<br/>that sits on even a pebble that has been found -<br/>likewise,<br/>our love<br/>may get<br/>eager to surrender<br/>in any way possible,<br/>and<br/>may completely lose track of<br/><em>who</em> it is surrendering to -<br/>this fear doesn't go away;<br/>to see her husband,<br/>in the darkness of the evening<br/>she wants to keep<br/>her small lamp<br/>burning,<br/>carefully.</p>

<p>Over and above that,<br/>in this chaste love of ours,<br/>there shall be beauty,<br/>and there shall be the joyfulness of grace.<br/>But,<br/>if modesty keeps lacking,<br/>if intellect gets perverted,<br/>then even this beauty<br/>gets corrupted.</p>

<p>Chaste <em>Maitreyii</em> -<br/>the prayer she had uttered -<br/>in that,<br/>none of the attributes of love was lacking.<br/>The Immortality She Wanted -<br/>that is Complete Love<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>,<br/>that is not<br/>an infatuated lust<br/>devoid of Work<br/>and<br/>bereft of Knowledge.<br/>She had uttered -<br/><em>Asato Maa Sadgamaya</em> -<br/>from untruth,<br/>Please Take me to Truth.<br/>She had uttered -<br/>I want Him Who <em>Is</em> Truth;<br/>on all sides,<br/>if I do not bind myself<br/>with the rules of Truth,<br/>with the Bondage of Truth -<br/>the Nuptial Bondage<br/>between Him and me<br/>shall never be Complete.<br/>In speech,<br/>in thoughts,<br/>in deed -<br/>we have to be true;<br/>then only<br/>He Who Is True in this Whole Universe,<br/>He Who Is True in this Whole World,<br/>He Who Is True in this Whole Human Society -<br/>with Him,<br/>our mergence shall become True;<br/>otherwise,<br/>at every step<br/>we shall keep stumbling.<br/>This worship<br/>is a difficult one -<br/>it is the Worship of Piety,<br/>it is the Worship of Work.</p>

<p>After that,<br/>she had uttered:<br/><em>Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamaya</em>.<br/>He, verily, Is the Essence of Knowledge;<br/>within this Whole Universe,<br/>He Exists as the Unchanging Truth;<br/>likewise,<br/>the truth we are knowing,<br/>that knowledge, verily, is the Manifestation of the Essence of Knowledge.<br/>It is verily therefore, that<br/>in the <em>Gaayatrii</em> hymn<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup><br/>on one hand<br/>the earth, the purgatory, and the heaven -<br/>within them<br/>it has been instructed<br/>to Witness His Truth;<br/>likewise,<br/>on the other hand<br/>within our knowledge<br/>it has been advised<br/>to realize the Presence of His Knowledge;<br/>He Who Is Projecting the Intellect -<br/>within knowledge,<br/>His Presence<br/>Must Be Recognized<br/>as the Essence of Intellect.<br/>Within this Universe,<br/>that Essence shall Merge with the Truth,<br/>within knowledge,<br/>we shall need to merge with the Knowledge.<br/>With Meditation,<br/>with Worship<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>,<br/>this Mergence shall become successful.</p>

<p>After that,<br/>the prayer is: <em>Mrityormaamritam Gamaya</em>!<br/>We are afflicting and furcating our love within death;<br/>May You Please Make it successful within the Infinite Love and Infinite Joy of Yours.<br/>In our psyche,<br/>the source of multifarious emotions,<br/>oh Essence of Emotion,<br/>may that source<br/>merge with Your Complete Ocean of Emotions<br/>and be fulfilled.<br/>Like this,<br/>our inner soul -<br/>may it become Complete<br/>in the Restraint of Truth,<br/>in the Light of Knowledge,<br/>and<br/>in the Emotion of Joy;<br/>may it receive within itself<br/>Him -<br/>Manifestation is Whose very Essence;<br/>thus,<br/>the Loving Face of <em>Rudra</em><br/>shall protect us for all eternity.</p>
