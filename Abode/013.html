<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>Just like this,<br/>day after day -<br/>rays after rays<br/>of light<br/>are pouring in.<br/>For so many eons,<br/>they are coming;<br/>they are coming every day.<br/>This Messenger of Light<br/>in the flower-garden<br/>every day morning<br/>is carrying a single hope;<br/>those buds that have only slightly germinated,<br/>the Messenger is telling them:<br/>'You do not know this today,<br/>but<br/>even you guys,<br/>completely opening up all your petals -<br/>in fragrance,<br/>in beauty,<br/>shall become fully bloomed.'<br/>This Messenger of Light,<br/>placing His Luminous Blessing<br/>on top of the paddy field -<br/>every day,<br/>is saying these words:<br/>'You guys are thinking,<br/>today -<br/>the breeze<br/>that has made you sway from side to side,<br/>and<br/>has made you soothe our eyes<br/>with your verdant beauty -<br/>maybe this<br/>verily completed<br/>all that you had to do;<br/>but,<br/>it is not so;<br/>one day,<br/>from the midst of your own lives -<br/>a ear<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> shall rise,<br/>and that ear<br/>shall fill everything<br/>with layer upon layer<br/>of harvest.'<br/>The flower that has not yet bloomed -<br/>Light is coming every day,<br/>carrying the anticipation of that flower;<br/>the crop that has not yet germinated -<br/>Light's Message is filled with the telltale assurance of that crop.<br/>This Luminous Hope -<br/>verily, every day -<br/>is visiting the flower-garden<br/>and<br/>the paddy field.</p>

<p>But this everyday light -<br/>this light<br/>is surely not coming <em>only</em> to the flower-garden<br/>and the paddy field.<br/>This light -<br/>every day morning,<br/>is opening up<br/>the curtain of our sleep.<br/>To us, too,<br/>doesn't this light have<br/>anything to say?<br/>To us, too,<br/>isn't this light<br/>bringing every day<br/>a hope -<br/>the fruitful form of which<br/>is perhaps<br/>lying helplessly ignorant<br/>within us, just like a little blossom,<br/>whose ear<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup><br/>even now,<br/>has not raised its head up, towards the sky -<br/>from within the kernel of our lives?</p>

<p>The Light -<br/>every day,<br/>is telling us<br/>only one word:<br/>'See.'<br/>That's all.<br/>'Open your eyes for once, and see.'<br/>Nothing else.</p>

<p>We open our eyes, we see.<br/>But<br/>that seeing is but a small blossom of seeing only;<br/>until now,<br/>that seeing is blind.<br/>In that seeing,<br/>the ear<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> that rises skyward -<br/>that contains within itself<br/>the assurance of bearing all future harvest<br/>of seeing,<br/>is yet to bloom.<br/>Open seeing is yet to come,<br/>Complete seeing we haven't seen yet.</p>

<p>But still, every day morning<br/>that Light -<br/>coming from many miles away<br/>is telling us:<br/>'See.'<br/>That one single hymn<br/>every day,<br/>It is Uttering in our ears -<br/>within that, there is an untiring assurance that remains hidden -<br/>within this seeing of ours<br/>there is an embryo of seeing<br/>whose complete development -<br/>the experience of that<br/>is still not awake within us.</p>

<p>But,<br/>don't think that<br/>these words of mine<br/>are but figures of speech.<br/>Don't think<br/>that<br/>I'm speaking<br/>using allegory.<br/>I'm not talking about Words of Knowledge,<br/>I'm not talking about Words of Meditation,<br/>I'm simply talking about seeing plainly with our eyes.</p>

<p>The seeing that Light shows us -<br/>that is definitely not a trifling thing.<br/>It does not show us<br/>only our own bed,<br/>only our own room -<br/>in the bright blue platter of the orb of the sky<br/>that spreads until the horizon -<br/>on that platter,<br/>the items It<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Decorates<br/>and keeps in front of us -<br/>how strange is that!<br/>Within that,<br/>we cannot find any end to wonder.<br/>Every day we need only so much;<br/>compared to that,<br/>this is so much more!</p>

<p>This huge affair -<br/>we're seeing every day;<br/>is this seeing<br/>an absolutely needless thing?<br/>Is it absolutely sans any reason,<br/>like the waste of the prodigal rich -<br/>on our four sides -<br/>has it only existed<br/>for being laid waste?<br/>Residing in the midst of such a grand view,<br/>we shall save some money,<br/>we shall accumulate some fame,<br/>we shall wield some power,<br/>and then<br/>one day we shall close our eyes<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>,<br/>and immediately,<br/>the wonderful opportunity to see such a huge World<br/>with our eyes open -<br/>shall end entirely finally!<br/>In this World,<br/>we had seen every day<br/>with eyes open -<br/>and Light<br/>Had Anointed these eyes<br/>every day -<br/>the full account of that -<br/>can that account<br/>be obtained<br/>in that money<br/>and fame<br/>and enjoyment?</p>

<p>No, it cannot be obtained.<br/>That is why I'm saying,<br/>just like this Light<br/>is telling<br/>a tale of Unthinkable Development<br/>every day,<br/>to the blind blossom -<br/>likewise,<br/>It Is Giving a Hope<br/>to our seeing:<br/>'There is an Ultimate Vision,<br/>there is a Final Vision;<br/>That Vision<br/>Exists within <em>You</em>.<br/>That Vision shall Bloom One Day,<br/>and That Is Why,<br/>Every Day,<br/>I'm Coming to You.'</p>

<p>Are you thinking,<br/>I'm talking about seeing in Meditation,<br/>eyes closed?<br/>I'm talking about seeing with these physical eyes.<br/>If you inveigh physical eyes as <em>physical</em> eyes,<br/>why will that do?<br/>That you shall hate these eyes<br/>for being physical -<br/>who are you<br/>to be such a big person?<br/>I'm saying,<br/>with these eyes,<br/>with these physical eyes<br/>there is a Vision to be seen<br/>which is<br/>the Ultimate Vision;<br/>if it were not there,<br/>then<br/>the Light is waking us up in vain,<br/>then such a huge Universe -<br/>This Universe that is decorated with planets and stars, the sun and the moon -<br/>This Universe that is filled with Life and Beauty -<br/>is Manifesting Itself<br/>on our four sides,<br/>day and night,<br/>in various shapes -<br/>in vain.<br/>To throw our vision on this World -<br/>is Science the Ultimate Success of that?<br/>The Earth is revolving around the Sun -<br/>on Its four sides;<br/>the Stars - each one of them - is a Solar System;<br/>that we shall know these truths -<br/>only for that<br/>in front of<br/>such a huge Universe,<br/>these two eyes of ours -<br/>their lids have opened?<br/>Knowing these,<br/>really,<br/>what shall happen?</p>

<p>Maybe, knowing these -<br/>there shall be many benefits;<br/>but,<br/>the benefits of knowing<br/>benefit knowing only;<br/>they fill the coffer of knowledge - let them.<br/>But, I'm talking about<br/>seeing with these eyes.<br/>I'm saying,<br/>even with these eyes<br/>we shall see something<br/>which we haven't seen<br/>yet.<br/>In front of us,<br/>on our four sides -<br/>whichever exist,<br/>we haven't seen<br/>any of those -<br/>not even that blade of grass.<br/>It is verily our mind<br/>that is occupying our eyes -<br/>the mind exists<br/>with so many bizarre thoughts -<br/>there is no end to them;<br/>with that thought of food and drink,<br/>of dresses and costumes,<br/>it has kept our vision obscured;<br/>it has heard from so many people,<br/>and has stored so many prejudices;<br/>it has so many fixed words,<br/>so many fixed judgements,<br/>there is no end to them;<br/>it does not know what is called body,<br/>it does not know what is called soul,<br/>it does not know what is called inferior,<br/>it does not know what is called superior,<br/>it does not know what is called finiteness,<br/>it does not know what is called the Infinite -<br/>it has no idea;<br/>being occupied with all these prejudices,<br/>our vision cannot<br/>clearly and freely<br/>receive the contact of the World,<br/>at all.</p>

<p>That is why,<br/>the Light -<br/>every day,<br/>rinsing our eyes<br/>off of the lethargy of slumber -<br/>is telling us:<br/>'You see clearly,<br/>you see cleanly<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>,<br/>like a lotus<br/>being completely open,<br/>sees the Sun -<br/>you see like that.'<br/>You will see whom?<br/>Him, Who is Seen in Meditation?<br/>No, not Him -<br/>you will verily see<br/>Him<br/>Who is Seen<br/>with these eyes.<br/>That Abode of Forms -<br/>from Whom<br/>Uncountable Streams of Forms<br/>have been pouring out<br/>since Eternity.<br/>On all four sides<br/>are Forms -<br/>It is verily a Play<br/>of Transformation<br/>from one Form to Another;<br/>Its End cannot be found anywhere -<br/>neither can we see the End,<br/>nor can we think about It.<br/>Fountains of Forms -<br/>on all sides -<br/>in all points of time -<br/>are only flowing out;<br/>and diving into That Ocean of Infinite Forms.<br/>That Being of Infinite Forms<br/>Who Is Beyond All Forms -<br/>when we shall see Him<br/>in His Play of Forms,<br/>then<br/>in the Light of this World,<br/>One Day -<br/>opening our eyes shall be successful,<br/>our everyday Anointment by the Light<br/>shall be successful.<br/>What we are seeing today,<br/>on four sides -<br/>we have some people -<br/>these people,<br/>we have some things -<br/>these things,<br/>one day -<br/>how we shall see these,<br/>in What Complete Connection with Consciousness -<br/>today we cannot imagine that;<br/>but we know this much -<br/>in front of this seeing with eyes of ours,<br/>Decorating the Whole World,<br/>the Light is Bringing a Message of Hope to us -<br/>that has not been Complete yet,<br/>at all.<br/>That the form of this tree<br/>is the Form of His Joy -<br/>we haven't seen That Vision yet;<br/>that the faces of people<br/>are the Forms of His Immortality -<br/>That Vision is thoroughly incomplete as of now;<br/><em>Aanandaruupamamritam</em><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> -<br/>this word,<br/>the day these two eyes of mine<br/>shall speak -<br/>on that day,<br/>they shall verily become successful.<br/>That Day,<br/>they shall verily see<br/>that Very Beautiful Face of His,<br/>that Propitious Face of His,<br/>His <em>Dakshinam Mukham</em>;<br/>even while looking towards the sky,<br/>they shall see That Face.<br/>It is then only<br/>that<br/>verily, everywhere,<br/>our heads shall bow down in obeisance;<br/>then,<br/>even in front of plants and trees<br/>our impudence shall be gone;<br/>then,<br/>we shall truly be able to say:<br/><em>Yo Vishvam Bhuvanamaavivesha, Ya Oshadhiishu Yo Vanaspatishu, Tasmai Devaaya Namonamah.</em><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>
