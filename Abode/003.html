<h3>Loss</h3>

<p>That we are leaving God out day and night -<br/>if it created a loss in our family worth even a quarter of a penny,<br/>we would have been alarmed immediately.<br/>But that danger is not there;<br/>the sun is giving us light;<br/>the earth is giving us food;<br/>the great local community is addressing our thousand needs through its thousand channels.<br/>Then what need of ours remains unmet by cutting God out of life!<br/>Alas!<br/>Until we know that loss, we rest assured and consider ourselves God's specially privileged children -<br/>living as we do in the midst of pomp, luxury and comfort.</p>

<p>But, how to inculcate the loss that is being incurred?</p>

<p>As an example, let me describe an experience here in the form of a dream that I recently had.<br/>I lost my mom at a very early age.<br/>As I grew up, mom was not there in my life.<br/>I dreamed last night as if I'm a child again.<br/>And mom is sitting in a room at the garden house beside Ganges<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.<br/>There is mom, OK, so what -<br/>her appearance doesn't always register in our Consciousness.<br/>I, too - paying no heed to her - passed by the very room where she was sitting.<br/>Suddenly, as I reached the balcony,<br/>what happened to me I don't know -<br/>'mom was there' - this thought rose in my mind.<br/>Immediately I went back to her room and paid obeisance to her - touching her feet.<br/>She held my hand and said: you've come!</p>

<p>And the dream ended right there.<br/>I started thinking -<br/>I'm living in <em>her</em> house,<br/>I'm passing through <em>her</em> doors ten times a day -<br/>I know she's there, there is no doubt;<br/>and yet this life is going on as if she's not there.<br/>But what is the problem with that!<br/>She has not closed her supply,<br/>she is feeding me every day,<br/>she is fanning me even as I am asleep.<br/>Except that part,<br/>where she is holding my hand and saying: 'you've come!'<br/>Food and drink, money and friends - everything is there,<br/>but where is that voice, that touch!<br/>When the Consciousness is fully awake,<br/>it yearns for that voice and that touch alone;<br/>and when it doesn't get that,<br/>it starts wondering room to room, filled with stuff;<br/>and finds no taste for all the food and drink.</p>

<p>Think carefully for a moment;<br/>it happens very rarely in life when we go to certain things, or to certain people in this world.<br/>It may so happen that we pass by one of our very close relatives several times every day;<br/>but it is only rarely, if at all, that we actually end up <em>reaching</em> that person.<br/>Perhaps I have talked to him/her many times when no one else was there;<br/>perhaps I have taken a walk with him/her many mornings and evenings - enjoying the sunshine together;<br/>but among all those times, I only remember the day when it filled my heart to know that I became <em>close</em> to him/her.<br/>There are hundreds and thousands of people who have never, ever, come in contact with anybody or anything in their entire life.<br/>They were born in this world,<br/>but have not touched it since.<br/>That they have not touched it -<br/>even this they don't know.<br/>They are laughing, playing, gossiping, making merry, doing dealings with others, and thinking:<br/>ah, how I'm enjoying life - mixing with others.<br/>That this enjoyment by mixing with others is virtually nothing compared to a heartfelt touch, is beyond their comprehension.</p>
