<h3>Initiation</h3>

<p>One day,<br/>he whose consciousness<br/>suddenly rose<br/>from the cozy bed of luxury,<br/>this 7th Paush day<br/>is the day of<br/>that Debendranath<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.<br/>This day<br/>he has bequeathed to us.<br/>Just the way a precious stone<br/>needs to be bequeathed -<br/>in the same way he has bequeathed.<br/>He has placed That Day<br/>in the midst of a Casket<br/>That Is this hermitage.<br/>Today we shall unlock That Casket -<br/>and<br/>we shall see that gemstone, placing it<br/>in the midst of the sky of this meadow;<br/>we shall see that gemstone, placing it<br/>in the midst of those stars -<br/>the constellation that is shining<br/>under the sky -<br/>the sky that belongs here,<br/>the sky that is bereft of dust,<br/>the sky that is clear -<br/>the sky that is separated from the rest of the World.<br/>The 7th Paush<br/>in the life of<br/>That Ascetic -<br/>today is the day to discover That;<br/>with That,<br/>today we make a festival.</p>

<p>This 7th Paush Day<br/>That Devotee<br/>Took His Initiation;<br/>That Initiation has such a big import -<br/>Is Today's Date<br/>Telling us<br/>any of those words?<br/>If we leave<br/>without listening to them,<br/>then<br/>what have we come here for,<br/>and<br/>what shall we leave with?</p>

<p>That Day -<br/>when in His Life<br/>the Sun of This 7th Paush<br/>Rose one day,<br/>on That Day<br/>no lamps were alight,<br/>no gathering of people was there -<br/>that clear winter day<br/>was quiet, was still.<br/>What was happening<br/>on That Day -<br/>even he himself<br/>didn't completely<br/>comprehend that;<br/>only That Indwelling Maker Was Comprehending.</p>

<p>That Initiation<br/>he took on That Day -<br/>it is no simple thing.<br/>That was not just an Initiation of Peace,<br/>that was an Initiation of Fire.<br/>His Master Had Told him<br/>on That Day -<br/>'This thing<br/>today<br/>you took from my hand -<br/>This is Truth;<br/>since<br/>you've accepted<br/>Its Weight -<br/>you won't have any coziness<br/>anymore -<br/>you shall have to keep awake<br/>night and day.<br/>To protect This Truth -<br/>even if you lose<br/>all that you have -<br/>then<br/>let all that you have<br/>be lost.<br/>But beware -<br/>in your hands<br/>may my truth<br/>not suffer<br/>any disrespect.'</p>

<p>Accepting This<br/>Bequest of Truth<br/>from His Master,<br/>after that<br/>He couldn't sleep<br/>anymore.<br/>His relatives left Him.<br/>His house left Him,<br/>His society left Him,<br/>His whole country became rife with condemnation -<br/>such a big family,<br/>so many distinguished friends,<br/>so many rich relatives,<br/>so many supports He had -<br/>He severed Himself<br/>from all of them;<br/>such an Initiation He took.<br/>Turning down<br/>all supports of the World -<br/>He has travelled<br/>with This Truth<br/>from one country to another,<br/>from one forest to another,<br/>from one mountain to another.<br/>For This is His Master's Truth.<br/>Having accepted<br/>the Responsibility<br/>of Protecting This Fire -<br/>there is no more coziness,<br/>there is no more sleep.<br/>That Initiation of Fire<br/>from Lord <em>Rudra</em><br/>is Residing<br/>in the midst of<br/>today's festival.<br/>But, Shall That Initiation<br/>Remain forever concealed?<br/>Entering in the midst of<br/>this music,<br/>this outcry,<br/>this uproar -<br/>He Who Is That <em>Bhayaanaam Bhayam Bhiishanam Bhiishanaanaam</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> -<br/>Will He not witness<br/>today,<br/>the Thunderous Form<br/>of His Fulgent Truth?<br/>He<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> had accepted<br/>That <em>Vajramudyatam</em><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup><br/>from the hands<br/>of His <em>Guru</em><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> -<br/>in the heart of this 7th Paush<br/>That Thunderous Verve Resides.</p>

<p>But,<br/>not just thunder,<br/>not just trial -<br/>the Boon and Courage<br/>That Reside<br/>in That Initiation -<br/>we shall have to visit Them as well.<br/>In the life of that rich kid<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup><br/>the days of crisis<br/>which had arrived -<br/>those, verily, are known to everyone.<br/>The huge opulence<br/>that was his support<br/>one day,<br/>like a king's palace -<br/>when that opulence<br/>suddenly crumbled<br/>above his head,<br/>and attempted to raze him to the ground,<br/>then<br/>in the midst of that<br/>horrible avalanche of danger,<br/>only This Initiation of Truth<br/>had covered him and protected him;<br/>on that day<br/>he didn't have<br/>any other worldly support.<br/>This Initiation -<br/>not only Had It Saved him<br/>from the<br/>acute impact of crisis days,<br/>but also<br/>Had Protected him<br/>from the<br/>even more acute attacks of enticement.</p>

<p>In the midst of this<br/>7th Paush of today,<br/>That Initiation of Truth of his -<br/>Its Fearsome Refulgence and Its Form of Boon and Courage -<br/>They Both Reside;<br/>if we are able to see That<br/>and<br/>receive even a tiny bit of That,<br/>then<br/>we shall be Blessed.<br/>What is called<br/>an Initiation of Truth -<br/>today<br/>if we are able to remember That with Piety,<br/>then<br/>we shall be Blessed.<br/>There is no hoax in this -<br/>no hide-and-seek,<br/>no hesitation,<br/>no tricks to maintain both sides,<br/>no skillfully prepared false argumentation to delude oneself,<br/>no double-blinding of Intellect to appease the Society,<br/>no stealing of God's property to sell off in human markets.<br/>That Truth -<br/>once we accept It in the midst of<br/>all torments of misery,<br/>then after that<br/>we are completely fearless,<br/>we are in complete possession of<br/>our Father's House -<br/>destroying our own little mud huts;<br/>the Destination of an entire Life -<br/>the Abode of Immortality -<br/>He Who Is the only Friend<br/>in That Path -<br/>Taking Refuge in Him alone -<br/>This Is the meaning of the Initiation of Truth.</p>

<p>That Blessed Ascetic<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> -<br/>The Day<br/>That Was bigger than all other days<br/>in His Life -<br/>The Day of His Initiation -<br/>in the midst of<br/>the open sky and clear light<br/>of these remote fields<br/>He Has Established That Day.<br/>On the four sides<br/>of That Great Day of His<br/>This Temple,<br/>This Hermitage,<br/>This School<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup><br/>are taking shape<br/>every day;<br/>our lives,<br/>our hearts,<br/>our consciousness<br/>have stood firm<br/>by surrounding It;<br/>it is for the Call of This Day alone<br/>that<br/>Well-being has been Incarnate<br/>and<br/>has appeared<br/>Here;<br/>and<br/>That Day of Initiation of Truth of His<br/>is inviting year after year<br/>to this festival of joy<br/>the rich and the poor,<br/>the young and the old,<br/>the learned and the illiterate.<br/>May we not<br/>keep This Day standing<br/>at one corner<br/>of<br/>the door<br/>to our unheeding lives;<br/>Please Call This Day<br/>in your heart<br/>with Devotion<br/>and<br/>with Respect,<br/>Please Fill the everyday emptiness<br/>that reigns<br/>in our wretched lives<br/>with Treasures<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Oh Initiator,<br/>Oh Teacher,<br/>if I'm not ready<br/>even now,<br/>then<br/>Please Make me ready,<br/>Please Strike me,<br/>Please Raise my consciousness everywhere -<br/>Please do not reject me,<br/>Please do not turn me down -<br/>Please do not push me<br/>at the very back<br/>of all Your Dignitaries<br/>because of my weaknesses.<br/>I have to accept Truth<br/>in this very life -<br/>without fear, and without shame.<br/>I shall not<br/>throw away<br/>my vain life<br/>in the garbage heap of untruth.<br/>I shall have to accept Initiation -<br/>Please Give me the Power.</p>
