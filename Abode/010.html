<h3>What do we look for?</h3>

<p>We, for so many days, from our prayer every day -<br/>what fruit did we look for?<br/>We looked for Peace.<br/>We thought -<br/>this prayer - like a huge tree - will give us shadow,<br/>will save us from the heat of the World every day.</p>

<p>But, looking for Peace, we cannot obtain Her.<br/>If we do not want Her much more than that,<br/>then even the Prayer to Peace gets wasted.</p>

<p>The fever patient says ruefully -<br/>may this burning of mine be cooled;<br/>perhaps (s)he dives into the water.<br/>The peace that comes from that -<br/>does not last;<br/>in fact, it may increase the heat.<br/>If the patient wants peace, not health -<br/>then (s)he gets neither peace nor health.</p>

<p>We too cannot do with Peace, we need Love<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.<br/>In fact, that little bit of Peace we get in mind,<br/>for some time a covering of softness comes upon us -<br/>it tricks us;<br/>we sit - rest assured in mind - our prayer was successful;<br/>and yet,<br/>we see no success<br/>on the Inside.</p>

<p>Because, we see that the disease has not gone away.<br/>Whole day, in sundry affairs, we see that the Relationship<br/>between the World and us has not become easy.<br/>Just like the relationship between a patient and his/her outer nature,<br/>this relationship has also become like that.<br/>Where there is but a slight chill on the outside,<br/>the patient's body is experiencing unbearable cold;<br/>where there is but a very slight touch on the outside,<br/>the patient's body is suffering from excruciating pain.<br/>Our state too is like that;<br/>in the behavior with Outside,<br/>our weight is not manifesting correctly.<br/>Small words are getting heard with great importance;<br/>small things are getting extremely heavy.</p>

<p>When does the weight increase?<br/>When its attraction towards the center increases.<br/>The light stuff we lift easily on earth -<br/>if we go to Jupiter,<br/>then there even that much might crush our bones.<br/>Because there - this attraction towards the center is much stronger than that on the earth.<br/>We are seeing that as well -<br/>our attraction towards our own center is extremely strong;<br/>our selfishness is only pulling us inside,<br/>our vanity is only pulling us inside -<br/>this is precisely why<br/>every thing is getting extremely heavy.<br/>That which is trivial -<br/>is continuously pressing me -<br/>owing only to that internal pull of mine;<br/>verily, every thing is choking me,<br/>every word is pushing me away -<br/>by momentary peace if we forget this,<br/>what is our gain in that?</p>

<p>When does this pressure lighten?<br/>When we are in Love<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.<br/>Then that pull goes outward.<br/>In our lives,<br/>many times we have seen the signature of that.<br/>The day when<br/>with our love interest<br/>our love-making<br/>has been especially successful -<br/>that day,<br/>not only has the light of the sky become brighter,<br/>not only has the greenery of the woods become greener,<br/>that day -<br/>in this World,<br/>the pull of our own weight<br/>has completely loosened.<br/>When on other days<br/>I give a beggar only a penny -<br/>on that day I give him/her a couple of quarters!<br/>Which is to say,<br/>on other days the weight a penny commanded -<br/>today,<br/>fifty pennies have that weight.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup><br/>On other days,<br/>the work that used to make me tired and exhausted -<br/>today, that work does not give me any tedium or exhaustion;<br/>suddenly the work has become lighter.<br/>The penny is still that same penny,<br/>the work is still that same work -<br/>only its weight has decreased.<br/>Because the pull today is not toward my own center;<br/>Love<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> has pulled me outward -<br/>has reduced the burden of the Whole World<br/>altogether, in a single instant.</p>

<p>Whatever our spiritual practice may be,<br/>if our World does not keep lightening with that -<br/>then we shall understand<br/>our goal has not been reached.<br/>If I understand the weight of money is still that fearsome,<br/>the burden of materials is still pressing me -<br/>I do not have the courage<br/>to throw away<br/>even the smallest<br/>among those,<br/>if I see<br/>the work as big -<br/>but its weight - as if - much bigger than that,<br/>then<br/>it is to be understood<br/>that Love has not arrived;<br/>the groom has not arrived<br/>in our welcoming session.</p>

<p>Then,<br/>what will happen with that little bit of peace?<br/>With that,<br/>our real thing will be cheated;<br/>we will be forced to settle for less.<br/>Within Love,<br/>there is not just Peace -<br/>there is Disquiet as well.<br/>Like the water of high tide,<br/>not only that has fullness,<br/>but also has a velocity -<br/>just like the former.<br/>That will not keep us sitting idly<br/>by filling us -<br/>that will pull us<br/>in a reverse current,<br/>away from the<br/>mouth of the low tide;<br/>it is verily then<br/>that<br/>with this Immobile World,<br/>we will not have to die -<br/>only tugging at it,<br/>only rowing strenuously with a single oar;<br/>that World will sail on its own -<br/>rapidly and effortlessly.</p>

<p>Until and unless<br/>that pull of Love catches us,<br/>we have no use with mere peace -<br/>until then,<br/>may we feel the Troubles.<br/>Until then,<br/>may we go to sleep at night<br/>with our pain - our sorrows;<br/>and may we<br/>wake up in the morning<br/>with our pain - our sorrows;<br/>oh Lord,<br/>please drown me<br/>in my own tears;<br/>oh Lord,<br/>please do not keep me<br/>at rest.</p>

<p>Every day morning,<br/>when the door out of darkness opens,<br/>then<br/>may I see<br/>my Friend standing there -<br/>be it a day of happiness,<br/>be it a day of misery,<br/>be it a day of danger -<br/>with You I met,<br/>today I have no worries anymore,<br/>today I shall be able to verily bear everything.<br/>When Love is not there,<br/>oh My Friend,<br/>it is then only<br/>that I plead for Peace.<br/>Then<br/>because my savings are short,<br/>I cannot<br/>tolerate<br/>any blows.<br/>But,<br/>when Love rises -<br/>then the sorrow and the misery -<br/>in which that Love shall be tested -<br/>even that sorrow and that misery<br/>I can carry on my head.<br/>Oh My Friend,<br/>at the time of prayer<br/>I shall not look for Peace anymore,<br/>I shall only look for Love<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.<br/>Love shall come<br/>in the Form of Peace,<br/>and<br/>in the Form of Disquiet;<br/>Love shall come<br/>in the Guise of Happiness,<br/>and<br/>in the Guise of Misery;<br/>May Love Come in any Guise -<br/>looking at His Face,<br/>may I be able to say:<br/>I have recognized You, my Friend, I have recognized You.</p>
