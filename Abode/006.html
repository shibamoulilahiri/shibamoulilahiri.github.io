<h3>Trials</h3>

<p>Our prayer hymn reads:</p>

<p align = "center"><em>Namah Shambhavaaya Cha Mayobhavaaya Cha!</em></p>

<p>May we all bow down to the Blissful Lord, the Beneficent Lord.<br/>But we bow down <em>only</em> to the Blissful Lord;<br/>we do not always bow down to the Beneficent Lord.<br/>It is because the Beneficent Lord is not only Blissful, but also Wrathful.<br/>We see His Favor <em>only</em> in happiness;<br/>and we de-emphasize life's trials as some sort of pitiable mishap.</p>

<p>Therefore, fearful and fragile as we are -<br/>we attempt to save ourselves from trials using various sorts of covering;<br/>we only want to hide from them.<br/>What comes therefrom?<br/>We only deprive ourselves of the complete contact of Truth.</p>

<p>The rich and the epicurean surround themselves with comfort only, shirking all forms of labor.<br/>What happens?<br/>They cripple themselves;<br/>they lose command over their hands and feet;<br/>the talents they were born with in this world - fail to mature owing to a complete lack of exercise -<br/>ultimately leading to wilt and decay.<br/>They live in an artificial world, encased within a hard shell -<br/>made all by themselves.<br/>An artificial world can never supply our nature with all its natural nutrients;<br/>therefore, in that condition, our temperament becomes like a homemade puppet;<br/>it never matures.</p>

<p>If we continuously try to save our subconscious from the blows of trials out of fear -<br/>then an incomplete life gets earmarked for us in this world;<br/>therefore, that life never protects our health, and neither helps mature our talents.<br/>One who did not receive any blow from trials after coming in this world,<br/>(s)he failed to receive her/his complete share of Gifts from God -<br/>her/his allowance decreased.</p>

<p>Those with a hyper-sensitive nature,<br/>friends and relatives all - try to escape them;<br/>it is because they make a big issue out of a tiny problem that people keep saying: 'give up on 'em' -<br/>with respect to them, others' words and behavior - none of those remains natural.<br/>They neither listen completely or correctly -<br/>nor do they receive their proper allowance fully and regularly.<br/>This can never bode well for them.<br/>One who never receives any blows from friends,<br/>only receives indulgence,<br/>that wretched fellow gets deprived of the full taste of friendship -<br/>her/his friends never totally become friends to her/him.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that our allotment of trials in this world will turn out to be entirely fair.<br/>Kinds of behavior we call unfair, we call unjust -<br/>those, too, will need to be accepted by us;<br/>if we try to grow ourselves as human beings only through propriety -<br/>by consulting the minutiae of our accounts ledger extremely carefully;<br/>that turns out to be impossible, and doesn't do us any good even if possible.<br/>Therefore, we need to develop the strength so that we can accept unfairness and injustice appropriately.</p>

<p>In this world, the measure of happiness we receive -<br/>does that also fall completely in accordance with the accounts?<br/>Is it not the case that all too often we end up buying a lot more than have been paid for out of our own pockets?<br/>And yet we never consider ourselves ineligible for that.<br/>Indeed, we <em>usurp</em> all of that in a fit of callous wantonness.<br/>Then, should we check our accounts on fairness and injustice -<br/>only at the time of trials?</p>

<p>There is a reason we don't receive anything exactly in accordance with the accounts.<br/>Our lives' activities keep moving through acceptance and dismissal;<br/>centripetal as well as centrifugal - these two powers are both equally important to us.<br/>Our lives, our talents, our sense of nobleness, our inclination to do good to others -<br/>effectively, all our excellent qualities - have as their underpinning that,<br/>they not only receive, but also renounce.</p>

<p>It is precisely because of this that our food never contains nutrients in exact accordance with our needs;<br/>it contains edible as well as inedible parts.<br/>Our bodies throw away the inedible parts.<br/>If we receive proper nutrients in their exact proportions,<br/>it will not do good to us;<br/>on the contrary, we will get sick.<br/>Reason -<br/>is it only because we have the power to digest, and a digestive mechanism?<br/>No.<br/>It is because we have the power to <em>discard</em>,<br/>and a mechanism to dismiss;<br/>we need that power and that mechanism be engaged as well;<br/>it is only then that a wholesome development shall take place,<br/>by harmonizing acceptance and dismissal.</p>

<p>Similarly,<br/>that in this world we shall only receive our fair share,<br/>that no one shall do us any injustice -<br/>this is not lawful.<br/>The intermixture of justice and injustice in this world is extremely necessary for our character.<br/>Like exhalation and inhalation,<br/>our character needs to possess a natural ability such that we can receive exactly as much as is our due - without effort,<br/>and discard exactly as much as is not - without resentment.</p>

<p>Therefore, the trials and blows -<br/>whether they are just or unjust -<br/>an excessive effort to rid ourselves of their contact endlessly,<br/>only weakens our human nature, and makes it sick.</p>

<p>Not only does this fear issue an epicurean fragility and weakness,<br/>but it also lays waste the purity of those hyper-sensitive people who veil themselves out of this fear.<br/>Under this veil they keep accumulating much dirt;<br/>the more they refuse to expose those before others -<br/>out of fear of public scrutiny,<br/>the more the dirt festers and perverts their health.<br/>Those who can accept -<br/>without any reservation or second thoughts -<br/>the condemnation, the unfairness, the sorrow and the misery this world offers,<br/>not only do they grow strong, but they also become pure,<br/>their faults keep decreasing by colliding fully with this world -<br/>flowing on top of an unveiled life.</p>

<p>Therefore, get ready with all your heart and psyche -<br/>pray to the Lord Who is Blissful, and pray to the Lord Who is Wrathful - as well;<br/>then only shall you gain in health and strength -<br/>and then only shall that prayer reach Him Who is Beneficent - the Most Benevolent.</p>
