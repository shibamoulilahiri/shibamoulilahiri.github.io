<h3>Hearing</h3>

<p>Since last evening,<br/>this song<br/>is only jingling in my mind -<br/>'It is playing, It is playing, the Delightful Harp is playing.'<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup><br/>No way<br/>I'm able to forget it -</p>

<p align = "center">It is playing, It is playing, the Delightful Harp is playing.<br/>In the midst of a hyaline lotus,<br/>In the midst of a moonlit night,<br/>In the midst of pitch-black clouds,<br/>In the midst of the fragrance of flowers,<br/>I verily hear the Harp's Rhythm -<br/>It's Playing to the Beats of Love<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Last night,<br/>as I was standing on the roof and watching the stars,<br/>my mind<br/>fully admitted:<br/>'It is Playing, It is Playing, the Delightful Harp is Playing.'<br/>This is not a poet's rhapsody -<br/>this is not a figure of speech -<br/>filling the Sky,<br/>filling the Time,<br/>day and night<br/>the Music is Playing.</p>

<p>When in the air,<br/>waves play with waves<br/>in a beautiful manner,<br/>then<br/>that wondrous union of theirs,<br/>and that beauty -<br/>our eyes cannot see;<br/>within our ears,<br/>That Play<br/>Reveals Itself<br/>in the Form of Songs.<br/>Again in the sky -<br/>when ripples of light<br/>in streams after streams,<br/>in amazing rhythms<br/>keep dancing -<br/>then That Beautiful Play -<br/>our ears<br/>do not receive<br/>any news of That -<br/>within our eyes,<br/>It Reveals Itself,<br/>with a particular Form.<br/>If we were able to welcome<br/>even This Play of the Space<br/>through the Portal of our Ears,<br/>then<br/>This Flourish of the Harp of the Universe<br/>we would have been able to recognize<br/>as<br/>songs.</p>

<p>This huge, immense Flooding<br/>of the Song of the Universe -<br/>when It Overflows<br/>the Whole Sky<br/>and<br/>Rushes towards our mind,<br/>then<br/>we cannot receive It<br/>merely through<br/>a single channel;<br/>we need to open up<br/>several channels -<br/>through our eyes,<br/>through our ears,<br/>through our nose,<br/>through our organ of touch -<br/>from several sides<br/>we receive It<br/>in several ways.<br/>This Great, Harmonious Music<br/>we see,<br/>hear,<br/>touch,<br/>smell,<br/>taste.</p>

<p>Even though we see with our eyes<br/>much of This Universe -<br/>we don't hear It with our ears -<br/>still,<br/>since antiquity<br/>many poets<br/>have called This Universe<br/>a song only.<br/>Thinkers of Ancient Greece<br/>have described<br/>the coming and going<br/>of<br/>heavenly bodies -<br/>their constellations -<br/>through Space,<br/>as a Song from the World of Stars only.<br/>With the Arrangement of Forms in This World, This Universe -<br/>poets have drawn parallels<br/>with Art -<br/>only very few times;<br/>one reason of that is<br/>in This Universe,<br/>there is a continuous restlessness of Motion.<br/>But, not just that -<br/>within It,<br/>there is a deeper reason.</p>

<p>One who draws pictures,<br/>(s)he needs a canvas,<br/>(s)he needs a brush,<br/>(s)he needs paint;<br/>her/his external arrangements<br/>are many.<br/>After that,<br/>when (s)he starts drawing -<br/>then,<br/>her/his opening lines<br/>do not show us<br/>the joy<br/>of the whole picture;<br/>once many lines<br/>and<br/>many colors<br/>come together,<br/>then only<br/>we get a hint<br/>of the Final Product.<br/>After that,<br/>once the drawing is over,<br/>even if the painter leaves -<br/>that picture<br/>keeps standing still -<br/>with the painter,<br/>it does not have any special relationship<br/>anymore.</p>

<p>But, (s)he who sings -<br/>all the arrangements of singing<br/>are verily <em>within</em> him/her;<br/>(s)he whose joy it is,<br/>it is her/his tune only;<br/>even the lyrics are hers/his -<br/>none of these are external.<br/>The Heart - as if -<br/>expresses Itself<br/>totally immediately;<br/>It does not have<br/>any intervention<br/>of materials, as well.<br/>This is why,<br/>although<br/>singing keeps waiting<br/>for a certain completeness,<br/>yet<br/>its every incomplete tune - as if -<br/>keeps expressing the Heart.<br/>Not only is it the case that<br/>This Expression of the Heart<br/>does not have<br/>any intervention of materials -<br/>the lyrics thing is an intervention too -<br/>because we need to think to understand their meaning -<br/>but in singing,<br/>even to understand that meaning<br/>has no necessity;<br/>even if there is no meaning<br/>only the tune says<br/>what is to say -<br/>in an indescribable manner.<br/>Beyond that -<br/>there is not<br/>even a moment of separation<br/>between the song, and the singer;<br/>if the singer departs -<br/>leaving the song incomplete -<br/>the song, too, leaves<br/>verily, with him/her.<br/>With the singer's life,<br/>with his/her energy,<br/>with his/her joy,<br/>the tune of song<br/>expresses itself<br/>verily,<br/>in a completely united way,<br/>all the time.<br/>Wherever there is singing,<br/>there, verily, is the singer;<br/>there is no exception to this.</p>

<p>Even This Song of the Universe -<br/>from Its Singer -<br/>is not separate - even for a moment.<br/>This Song -<br/>It is not even made of<br/>The Singer's external arrangements.<br/>It is completely His/Her Psyche,<br/>within His/Her Breath,<br/>Rising with the Form of His/Her Joy.<br/>This Song -<br/>Being Fully Complete,<br/>Resides in His/Her Heart;<br/>and yet,<br/>It is Manifesting Itself<br/>gradually,<br/>in the Form of Expressions;<br/>but Its Each Melody verily Contains<br/>the Advent of That Complete Song;<br/>It is Going About,<br/>Connecting<br/>one melody with another,<br/>in Joy.<br/>When we do not receive<br/>any effable meaning<br/>from This Song of the Universe,<br/>even then<br/>to our mind,<br/>Its Expression<br/>Does Not Encounter<br/>any obstruction.<br/>This is verily because<br/>It is an Immediate Revelation<br/>to mind,<br/>of Mind.</p>

<p>In the <em>Gaayatrii</em> hymn,<br/>that is why we hear<br/>That Effulgence of the Progenitor of the Universe,<br/>His Radiance,<br/>His Energy -<br/>through the Earth,<br/>through the Purgatory,<br/>and<br/>through the Heaven -<br/>are only Overflowing,<br/>and<br/>That One Energy of His -<br/>His only -<br/>is continuously Radiating<br/>in our mind<br/>as Intellect.<br/>It is only Rising,<br/>It is only Projecting<br/>melody after melody,<br/>tune after tune.</p>

<p>Last night -<br/>eleventh of the new moon -<br/>filling the deep darkness<br/>of a solitary night,<br/>That Harpist was Playing<br/>His Delightful Harp;<br/>at the End of the World,<br/>I was listening -<br/>standing alone;<br/>in That Flourish,<br/>all the Worlds of Stars<br/>in the Infinite Sky<br/>were Reverberating -<br/>were Being Connected,<br/>in the Wonderful, Silent Music.<br/>Afterwards,<br/>when I went to bed,<br/>then<br/>I fell asleep with this assurance in mind that,<br/>when I shall remain unaware in sleep -<br/>even then,<br/>That Awake Harpist -<br/>His night-time Play of Harp<br/>shall not Cease -<br/>even then,<br/>That Rhythm of Sound of His -<br/>the Rhythm that is Making the World of Stars Dance,<br/>it is in That very Rhythm<br/>that<br/>in this theater of my body - solitary from sleep -<br/>the Dance of Life shall Continue;<br/>the Dance of my Heart shall not Stop;<br/>Blood shall Dance in all my organs;<br/>and<br/>millions of live cells -<br/>all over my body -<br/>shall keep vibrating<br/>verily with the Rhythm<br/>of That Music of the Assembly of Heavenly Bodies.</p>

<p>'It is Playing, It is Playing, the Delightful Harp is Playing.'<br/>Again,<br/>our Master<br/>has Given<br/>in our arms too,<br/>a small harp -<br/>one each<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.<br/>His Wish -<br/>we too,<br/>learn to play with Him -<br/>attuning ourselves with Him.<br/>In His Assembly,<br/>sitting next to Him,<br/>we shall accompany Him a little -<br/>This is His Endearing Desire.<br/>The Harp of Life is Small,<br/>but<br/>He has Mounted so many strings in It!<br/>Setting up<br/>all the strings<br/>to proper tune -<br/>is that a small thing!<br/>If this one works,<br/>then<br/>that one does not;<br/>if the mind works,<br/>the body starts complaining;<br/>if one day the tempo works,<br/>then another day<br/>it goes down.<br/>But, it will not do to give up.<br/>One day,<br/>from His Mouth -<br/>we shall have to hear these words -<br/>'wow, son, well-done.'<br/>The Harp of this Life<br/>one day,<br/>shall play<br/>all of Her Symphony<br/>at His Feet -<br/>'crooning, and crooning.'<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup><br/>For now,<br/>only this much<br/>we shall have to keep in mind that,<br/>we need to set up all the strings rather tautly -<br/>any laxity<br/>makes them<br/>jangle and clank.<br/>Just like<br/>we shall need to fix the Harp tautly,<br/>even then,<br/>we shall need to keep It free -<br/>if something obstructs It from top,<br/>It Refuses to Play again.<br/>If you want<br/>the pure melody -<br/>only that much -<br/>then watch out,<br/>may the strings not catch any dirt,<br/>may the strings not gather any rust;<br/>and<br/>every day,<br/>pray whilst sitting at His Feet -<br/>'My Teacher! Please Take me from dissonance to consonance.'</p>
