<h3>Prayer</h3>

<p><em>Upanishads</em> are a huge tree<br/>for God-Realization<br/>in India.<br/>They are not only<br/>beautiful, green, and shady -<br/>but they are also big,<br/>and they are difficult.<br/>Within them,<br/>not only is the Abundance of Realization luxuriated,<br/>but also is the harshness of spiritual austerities gone aloft.<br/>Amidst that<br/>sky-piercing, very hard, stoicism -<br/>there is a sweet flower blossomed -<br/>its fragrance<br/>has made us<br/>restless.<br/>That flower<br/>is that prayer hymn<br/>uttered by <em>Maitreyii</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When <em>Yajnavalkya</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup><br/>at the point of leaving home,<br/>was ready to bequeath<br/>all his property<br/>to his two wives -<br/><em>Maitreyii</em> asked,<br/>ok, can you tell me<br/>whether with these properties<br/>I shall become immortal?<br/><em>Yajnavalkya</em> replied,<br/>no, that shall not happen,<br/>but like the life of a materialist,<br/>your life shall become like that.<br/>Like the worldly people<br/>with their houses, pets, domesticated animals,<br/>food and drink, dresses and costumes -<br/>spend their days at ease,<br/>like that<br/>you guys<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> shall be able to spend your days.</p>

<p><em>Maitreyii</em> then instantly replied:<br/><em>Yenaaham Naamritaa Syaam Kimaham Tena Kuryaam!</em><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup><br/>By which<br/>I shall not become immortal,<br/>what shall I do with that!<br/>This, verily, is not an utterance of harsh Knowledge -<br/>She did not speak these words<br/>by achieving discrimination between<br/>what is Real and what is Unreal<br/>in the practice of thought-control, in the practice of meditation.<br/>In Her Mind<br/>there was a touchstone<br/>on which<br/>rubbing all the materials in this World<br/>just once,<br/>She Spoke Up: 'What I want is verily not these.'</p>

<p>In the <em>Upanishads</em>,<br/>in the midst of all male ascetics' sayings -<br/>solemn from Knowledge,<br/>this only one ardent sentence<br/>has sounded<br/>in only one female voice,<br/>and that sound<br/>has not melted away.<br/>That sound,<br/>in the midst of their<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> thunder-clapping, calm voice -<br/>has kept awake<br/>a glorious tearful sweetness.<br/>The male that resides in human beings -<br/>in the <em>Upanishads</em><br/>in sundry sides, in sundry ways<br/>we had obtained the encounter of only that.<br/>It is at that time<br/>that<br/>suddenly in one fringe we saw -<br/>the <em>female</em> that resides in human beings;<br/>she, too, is standing with beauty radiating from her.</p>

<p>In our inner nature too,<br/>there is a Female.<br/>We bring all our savings to Her.<br/>We bring riches,<br/>and say: take this.<br/>We bring fame,<br/>and say: you store this.<br/>Our Male -<br/>for His Whole Life,<br/>with utmost labor -<br/>from various sides,<br/>is bringing<br/>various stuff;<br/>what He is bringing,<br/>there is no estimate of that;<br/>He is telling the Female:<br/>with these,<br/>you make a household,<br/>you do the housewifery well, in an orderly manner;<br/>with these,<br/>you live in happiness.<br/>Our inner female ascetic,<br/>even now,<br/>is not able to clearly say:<br/>all these will not give any fruit to me.<br/>She is thinking,<br/>perhaps<br/>what I want -<br/>this is verily it.<br/>And yet,<br/>even after receiving all those,<br/>her mind is not believing in 'I got everything'.<br/>She is thinking hard,<br/>maybe the <em>amount</em> of stuff needs to increase further -<br/>I need more money,<br/>I need more fame,<br/>I cannot do without more power.<br/>But that 'more' never ends.<br/>Effectively, that she wants immortality -<br/>this, one day, she must understand.<br/>One day,<br/>in a single instant -<br/>pushing the heap of the savings of whole life<br/>to one side<br/>like garbage,<br/>she will have to speak up:<br/><em>Yenaaham Naamritaa Syaam Kimaham Tena Kuryaam!</em></p>

<p>But,<br/>that <em>Maitreyii</em> spoke thus:<br/>'What shall I do with things that shall not make me immortal',<br/>what is the meaning of that utterance?<br/>Is the meaning of<br/>becoming immortal -<br/>carrying this earthly body around<br/>for all eternity?<br/>Or,<br/>even after death<br/>somehow surviving<br/>in another birth,<br/>or<br/>in another state?<br/>That <em>Maitreyii</em><br/>did not want<br/>immortality of the body,<br/>and that<br/>she had no qualms<br/>regarding the<br/>imperishability of the soul -<br/>this is incontestable.<br/>Then,<br/>how had she<br/>wanted to become immortal?</p>

<p>She spoke thus,<br/>in this World<br/>we are only<br/>moving through one<br/>to another -<br/>no way<br/>we are able to keep<br/>staying at rest.<br/>The objects of my mind move away,<br/>my mind also moves away.<br/>The object my mind holds on to -<br/>when I leave that,<br/>then with respect to that<br/>my death occurs.<br/>Like this,<br/>we are always moving<br/>through one death<br/>to another -<br/>this series of deaths -<br/>it has no end.</p>

<p>And yet,<br/>my mind<br/>wants something<br/>from which it does not have to move anymore,<br/>getting which it can say,<br/>'other than this I don't want anything anymore';<br/>getting which there will not be any talk about parting anymore.<br/>It is then, verily, that the clutch of death shall be completely avoided.<br/>Who is such a person,<br/>what is such a material -<br/>with which I can say,<br/>with this, verily, I received the repatriation of my whole life -<br/>there is no need<br/>of anything anymore!</p>

<p>It is verily therefore,<br/>that<br/>pushing all the properties and objects left by her husband aside,<br/><em>Maitreyii</em> spoke up,<br/>'What shall I do with all these? I, verily, want Immortality.'</p>

<p>OK, so,<br/>materials are not Immortality,<br/>then what is Immortality!<br/>We know what Immortality is.<br/>It is not that<br/>we did not get Its Taste at all<br/>on this earth.<br/>If we did not,<br/>then<br/>for that<br/>our tears<br/>wouldn't have welled up.<br/>We are only<br/>looking for that<br/>in all our affairs in this World,<br/>the reason for that is -<br/>every other moment It touches us,<br/>and passes by.</p>

<p>Within Death,<br/>this Touch of Immortality -<br/>where do we get?<br/>Where our love resides.<br/>It is verily in our love<br/>that<br/>we obtain the taste of the Infinite.<br/>It is verily love<br/>that<br/>casting a shadow of the Infinite<br/>within the Finite,<br/>keeps the old, new;<br/>it never accepts Death.<br/>In this World,<br/>within sundry objects -<br/>seeing this hint of love<br/>we receive the intimation of this Ultimate Substance<br/>beyond Death -<br/>that His Essence is the Essence of Love,<br/>we realize that;<br/>again,<br/>when to receive this love completely<br/>we discover<br/>the true want of our inner nature,<br/>then we can say - after pushing all materials away quite easily:<br/><em>Yenaaham Naamritah Syaam Kimaham Tena Kuryaam.</em><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>This utterance -<br/>when this utterance<br/>has come from a female mouth,<br/>then<br/>how clear,<br/>how true,<br/>how sweet<br/>it has become.<br/>Avoiding all thought-control processes, avoiding all argumentation<br/>how easily<br/>it has been spoken.<br/>Oh my Lord,<br/>I do not want<br/>houses and riches at all,<br/>I want love;<br/>what kind of lament is this!</p>

<p>That simple lament of <em>Maitreyii</em><br/>had woken up,<br/>taking the form of a prayer -<br/>that kind of wonderful, complete prayer -<br/>in this World -<br/>has that kind of prayer<br/>ever been heard<br/>anywhere else?<br/>The earnest prayer<br/>of the heart of Whole Humanity<br/>has received the form of an utterance<br/>for all Eternity -<br/>in that ardent voice<br/>of this lady.<br/>It is verily this prayer<br/>that is the <em>only</em> prayer<br/>for all of us,<br/>and it is verily this prayer<br/>that<br/>in the great history of Humanity in this World<br/>has been uttered<br/>in every age and era.</p>

<p><em>Yenaaham Naamritaa Syaam Kimaham Tena Kuryaam</em> -<br/>speaking these words with force,<br/>did that female Knower of <em>Brahman</em> immediately rise up with folded hands,<br/>and turning her tearful face towards the sky, utter? -</p>

<p align = "center"><em>Asato Maa Sadgamaya<br/>Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamaya<br/>Mrityormaamritam Gamaya.<br/>Aaviraaviirma Edhi<br/>Rudra Yatte Dakshinam Mukham<br/>Tena Maam Paahi Nityam.</em><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In the <em>Upanishads</em>,<br/>in male voice<br/>we have obtained<br/>many utterances<br/>of<br/>profound Realization,<br/>but<br/>in female voice<br/>we have obtained<br/>only this one<br/>discerning prayer.<br/>What we really want,<br/>and yet what is lacking,<br/>the intense feeling of that -<br/>has revealed itself very easily<br/>in a female heart laden with love. -<br/>Oh Truth,<br/>from all untruths<br/>please take me within you;<br/>for otherwise,<br/>our Love<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> remains starving!<br/>Oh Light,<br/>from deep darkness<br/>please take me within you;<br/>for otherwise,<br/>our Love remains imprisoned!<br/>Oh Immortality,<br/>through relentless deaths<br/>please take me within you;<br/>for otherwise,<br/>our Love -<br/>like the lost wanderer<br/>in an imminent night -<br/>keeps wandering without any refuge!<br/>Oh Appearance,<br/>please appear to me;<br/>only that much<br/>will make<br/>all my Love successful.<br/><em>Aaviraaviirma Edhi</em> -<br/>oh <em>Aavih</em>,<br/>oh Manifestation,<br/>You are always Manifesting;<br/>but You please,<br/>for once,<br/>be mine;<br/>Manifest on behalf of me -<br/>within me,<br/>May Your Manifestation<br/>be fulfilled.<br/>Oh <em>Rudra</em><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>,<br/>oh Fearsome,<br/>You Are the Unbearable <em>Rudra</em>, Manifesting in the Form of Separation<br/>within the Darkness of Sin;<br/><em>Yatte Dakshinam Mukham</em>,<br/>the Propitious and Beautiful Face of Yours,<br/>the Face of Love of Yours,<br/>please Show me That only -<br/><em>Tena Maam Paahi Nityam</em>,<br/>Showing That Face,<br/>please Protect me,<br/>please Save me,<br/>please Save me for Eternity -<br/>That Manifestation of Love of Yours,<br/>That Propitiousness,<br/>verily,<br/>is my Salvation for Eternity.</p>

<p>Oh Female Ascetic <em>Maitreyii</em>,<br/>please Come,<br/>in the midst of the people in this World -<br/>afflicted with their own materials -<br/>within their heart,<br/>please Place Your two Blessed Feet today.<br/>That Prayer for Immortality of Yours -<br/>in Your Immortal, Sweet Voice -<br/>please Utter in my heart<br/>before You Leave.<br/>For All Eternity,<br/>how I shall remain Protected -<br/>may my mind<br/>not bear<br/>even the<br/>least trace of suspicion<br/>regarding that.</p>
