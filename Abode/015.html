<h3>Accounts</h3>

<p>Every day,<br/>we only wish to<br/>tell others<br/>about the <em>profits</em> we made.<br/>Our minds<br/>do not venture<br/>into introducing<br/>the topic of accounts.<br/>We wish<br/>to only delve into<br/>the juicy details;<br/>the vessel in which<br/>that juice resides -<br/>we consider<br/>that<br/>very hard.</p>

<p>But,<br/>in the lower story of Immortality -<br/>Truth is Sitting;<br/>there is no way<br/>to totally exclude Him,<br/>and<br/>go to That Realm of Joy.</p>

<p>Truth is the Essence of Rules.<br/>If we have to obey Him,<br/>we definitely need to obey<br/>All His Rules.<br/>Whatever is True -<br/>which is to say,<br/>Whatever Is<br/>and<br/>Whatever Exists -<br/>They cannot be free from Rules<br/>in any way;<br/>They Exist<br/>verily because<br/>They Exist within some Rules.<br/>The truth<br/>that does not have<br/>any rules,<br/>any bondage -<br/>that is a mere dream,<br/>that is a mere whim;<br/>that is even more illusory than the dream,<br/>that is even more empty than the whim.</p>

<p>He Who Is the Essence of Complete Truth -<br/>He Does Not Get Bound by others' rules;<br/>His Own Rules<br/>Are<br/>within Himself only.<br/>If that does not happen -<br/>if He has not Bound Himself,<br/>then nothing can come out of Him,<br/>then nothing can be saved from Him.<br/>Then in the rampaging dance of madness<br/>nothing would have had any fixity anymore.</p>

<p>But, we can see -<br/>the very Form of Truth are Rules -<br/>completely indefectible Rules;<br/>not a single end of Them<br/>has even a shade of exceptions.<br/>This is precisely why<br/>in the Bondage<br/>of This Truth,<br/>the Whole Universe<br/>has remained imbedded;<br/>this is precisely why<br/>with Truth,<br/>our intellect has connections,<br/>and<br/>upon That Truth,<br/>our Total Dependence Exists.</p>

<p>Just like a tree<br/>requires at the beginning<br/>to go deep into the soil<br/>with its roots,<br/>likewise,<br/>we too<br/>in the beginning -<br/>need to<br/>establish ourselves upon Truth<br/>with innumerable big and small roots.</p>

<p>Whether we wish or not -<br/>this practice we have to perform.<br/>A baby cries out: 'I shall walk upon my feet';<br/>but, till the moment<br/>(s)he can negotiate gravity<br/>by obeying the rules of walking -<br/>after much practice -<br/>until that moment,<br/>(s)he has no other recourse -<br/>only saying 'I shall walk' shall not do.</p>

<p>These rules of walking -<br/>whenever the baby accepts them,<br/>then<br/>these rules<br/>do not torment him/her<br/>anymore.<br/>Not only is it the case that<br/>they do not torment him/her,<br/>but<br/>they also give joy to him/her;<br/>the moment<br/>the baby acknowledges<br/>the Bondage of True Rules -<br/>(s)he gains his/her own Power of Walking,<br/>and becomes joyful.</p>

<p>Thus,<br/>gradually -<br/>when (s)he learns to<br/>completely obey<br/>the truth of water,<br/>the truth of soil,<br/>the truth of fire -<br/>then<br/>not only are some of his/her inconveniences got rid of,<br/>but<br/>with respect to<br/>water, soil, fire -<br/>his/her powers become successful,<br/>and also give joy to him/her.</p>

<p>Not only with the Nature of the Universe -<br/>but with society too,<br/>in order to be able to connect with the Society<br/>in True Relationship -<br/>the baby<br/>needs to perform<br/>a lot of practice;<br/>(s)he needs to accept<br/>a lot of rules;<br/>(s)he needs to stop<br/>a lot of indulgences,<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup><br/>(s)he needs to lessen<br/>a lot of anger;<br/>(s)he needs to bind himself/herself<br/>in a lot of ways,<br/>and (s)he needs to do that<br/>with a lot of people.<br/>When accepting these rules<br/>becomes easy for him/her,<br/>then<br/>living in the society becomes joyful to him/her as well;<br/>it is verily then, that<br/>his/her powers with respect to the society -<br/>with the help of those very bondages of rules -<br/>those diverse bondages of rules -<br/>become free from obstructions,<br/>and<br/>receive great joy.</p>

<p>Thus -<br/>when most of the people<br/>within the Nature of the Universe<br/>and<br/>within Society -<br/>become more-or-less passable,<br/>it is verily then<br/>that<br/>they start feeling secure,<br/>and<br/>considering themselves unimpeachable,<br/>become happy.</p>

<p>But there is a certain kind of money<br/>that works in villages but not in cities,<br/>works in a cheap store of the city but not in a bank.<br/>If we go to a bank to redeem the value of that,<br/>then immediately<br/>the banker who is there -<br/>(s)he recognizes it as bogus<br/>with nothing more than a single touch,<br/>and voids it on the spot.</p>

<p>Our condition, too, is just like that -<br/>in our house,<br/>in our village,<br/>in our society<br/>we have kept ourselves tolerable -<br/>but,<br/>when we stand in a big bank,<br/>then immediately -<br/>to the banker,<br/>in a single moment<br/>all our impurities get exposed.</p>

<p>If we want to be present there -<br/>then we shall need to be True, even more True.<br/>We shall have to bind ourselves<br/>with<br/>many more rules;<br/>we shall have to accept<br/>many more liabilities.<br/>In That Market of Immortality -<br/>even a tiny bit of fakeness won't work;<br/>unless we become Completely Pure Truth<br/>we cannot hope to buy Immortality.</p>

<p>That is why<br/>I was saying -<br/>if we only keep talking about the Elixir of Immortality,<br/>that won't work;<br/>we shall also need to<br/>see to the Accounts of That.</p>

<p>When we sit to check our own accounts,<br/>then even if there is a discrepancy of two to four rupees,<br/>we say: oh that doesn't matter.<br/>Thus, every day<br/>the discrepancies only keep accruing.<br/>With Nature and with People<br/>in our behavior every day<br/>large and small -<br/>so many untruths and so many misdeeds<br/>we are perpetrating -<br/>if word arises with respect to them,<br/>we immediately say:<br/>'those things always happen,<br/>many people do those things,<br/>those things do not imply that<br/>I need to<br/>get out of the Civil Society.'</p>

<p>In the ledger of domestic accounts<br/>these kinds of laxity take place;<br/>but those who are honest by birth<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>,<br/>those who are great people<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> -<br/>if in a business worth one lakh rupees<br/>the accounts of a single paisa cannot be settled -<br/>they cannot sleep<br/>all night.<br/>Those who are looking at big profits -<br/>they fear even a minute discrepancy;<br/>they cannot live<br/>without making their accounts completely and impeccably true.</p>

<p>That is why I was saying,<br/>That Ultimate Emotion - the Emotion of Love<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>,<br/>if we want to grow up to be the Banker of That -<br/>then<br/>calling the Accounts Ledger dry,<br/>and<br/>eluding It by even a tiny amount<br/>shall not do.<br/>He Who Is the Treasurer of Immortality -<br/>to Him -<br/>whimsical requests<br/>shall not work at all.<br/>For He Is a Great Accountant -<br/>in This Huge Affair of the Universe,<br/>there is no error in Accounting anywhere -<br/>to Him,<br/>in what excuse<br/>shall I go and say,<br/>'I don't know anything else,<br/>I don't recognize anything else<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>,<br/>Please Give me Love<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> only,<br/>Please Make me mad with Love.'</p>

<p>The day<br/><em>Maitreyii</em> cried out<br/>for Immortality,<br/>the first thing<br/>She said was,<br/>'<em>Asato Maa Sadgamaya</em> -<br/>Please Bind my life, my psyche<br/>in Truth -<br/>delivering them from<br/>all wayward untruths;<br/>the Talk of Immortality<br/>can happen<br/>after that.'</p>

<p>We too have to perform that very prayer<br/>every day;<br/>we too have to say;<br/><em>Asato Maa Sadgamaya</em> -<br/>Please Do Not Let my mind<br/>be scattered to thousand pieces<br/>in lawless, unrestrained untruth;<br/>Please Bind it<br/>completely -<br/>in the Unworn Thread of Truth;<br/>after that,<br/>That Necklace -<br/>if I want to put It on Your neck,<br/>then<br/>I shall not have to be ashamed.</p>
