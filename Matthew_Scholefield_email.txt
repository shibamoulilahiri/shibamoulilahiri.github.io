Hello,

Regarding your Gutenberg dataset, I noticed the following file was unlike the rest and encoded in cp1252 rather than standard utf-8:

Gutenberg/txt/Henry David Thoreau___A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.txt

I just wanted to let you know I found the dataset very useful, and it might help other people to re-encode that file. Here's a modified zip where I ran the following python code on it:

filename = 'Gutenberg/txt/Henry David Thoreau___A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.txt'
with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
data = f.read().decode('cp1252').encode('utf-8')

with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
f.write(data)

Thanks,
Matthew
