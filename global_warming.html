With an unusually hot January that I bet everyone cared to notice, it is imperative - once again - to discuss global warming and its potential. Please note that its analogy to a boiling frog is all over the Internet (<a href = "https://qz.com/1118052/climate-change-is-the-slowly-boiling-frog-in-the-pot-of-the-earth/">here</a>, <a href = "https://www.sovhealth.com/depression/boiling-frog-examining-effects-global-warming-mental-health/">here</a>, <a href = "https://www.care2.com/causes/global-warming-and-the-story-of-the-frog-in-the-pot.html">here</a>, <a href = "http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/08/07/before-the-century-ends-it-may-be-too-hot-for-people-to-work-outside/">here</a>), as is its analogy to atomic bombs (<a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/global-warming-of-oceans-equivalent-to-an-atomic-bomb-per-second">here</a>, <a href = "http://4hiroshimas.com/">here</a>, <a href = "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/8147216/global-warming-heats-oceans-atomic-bomb/">here</a>, <a href = "https://weather.com/science/environment/video/oceans-heating-at-rate-of-atomic-bomb-per-second-0?isSubsequent=true">here</a>, <a href = "https://news.yahoo.com/global-warming-heating-oceans-power-atomic-bomb-every-second-111725391.html">here</a>, <a href = "https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/hiroshima-kyoto-and-the-bombs-of-climate-change">here</a>, <a href = "https://www.beforetheflood.com/explore/the-deniers/fact-our-planet-is-warming-at-a-rate-of-4-atomic-bombs-per-second/">here</a>.) However, that does not do complete justice to the global catastrophe we shall be facing together in the coming decades - all around the globe. Here I'd like to give you an idea of what it actually <em>is</em> - based on the movie <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Destination_3">"Final Destination 3"</a>. You can watch the movie online for a nominal fee. The scene I'd like to draw your attention to, is the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVj93pJuiyM">death</a> of Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin, as depicted <a href = "http://final-destination-movie.wikia.com/wiki/Ashley_Freund">here</a>. See how Ashley and Ashlyn - two young girls barely out of school - were roasted alive when a tanning machine malfunctioned? That's global warming - happening to us. All of us. We need to do something. NOW. - Shibamouli Lahiri, Jan 9 2019.
