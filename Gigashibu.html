<h1 align = "center"><u>Gigashibu</u></h1>

<p align = "center">Gigashibu is grounded in spirituality; that's the biggest need of our times.</p>

<p align = "center">We strive to understand our customers spiritually first, and only then we think about implementing software and/or coding solutions for them, as appropriate.</p>

<p align = "center">We strive to understand our customers spiritually first (hence the need for face-to-face (with masks and social distancing) consultations), and only then we think about implementing software and/or coding solutions for them, as appropriate.</p>

<p align = "center">This is esp. important for customers we're meeting for the first time. It helps us understand each other and bond in a deeper way.</p>

<p align = "center">The spiritual consultations are absolutely free of charge; however, we do appreciate if customers made some small gifts to defray our expenses.</p>

<p align = "center">In the second phase of the consultation, we strive to understand the design/analysis problem the customer is facing; it could be a minor software bug to a major security glitch; we have your back. This phase <i>is</i> charged; however, we do understand that each customer has unique and special needs, and we respect their choices. Moreover, our pricing is flexible, and we strive to attenuate our approach as best as we can, in order to benefit you.</p>

<p align = "center">In the third phase, we design and analyze the customer issues to arrive at a solution that provides <i>long-term</i> and <i>useful</i> benefits for our customers; this phase is charged as well.</p>

<p align = "center">In the third phase of consulting, we analyze the customer issues to design a solution with <i>long-term</i> and <i>useful</i> benefits. This phase is charged, as outlined above.</p>

<p align = "center">Our team includes experts in content writing, software engineering, statistics, data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, programming languages, and finance. We draw from a diverse body of experience, and latest research and development in academia as well as in the industry. Our methods cut deep.</p>

<p align = "center">While cloud, blockchain and hardware technologies are not core areas of our expertise, we can still give you useful and sound advice on those issues, and may even come up with solutions that will save you hours if not days or weeks of wasted time and money.</p>

<p align = "center">We further provide basic advice and expert suggestions on ayurveda; it is, however, not one of our core offerings.</p>
